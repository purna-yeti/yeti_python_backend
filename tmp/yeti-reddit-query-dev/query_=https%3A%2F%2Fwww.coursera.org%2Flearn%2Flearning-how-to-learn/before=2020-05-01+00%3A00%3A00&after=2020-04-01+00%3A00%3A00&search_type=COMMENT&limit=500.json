You're probably wondering WTF did this dude put in your education section, right?  Listen, not having certain levels of education is NOT the end of the world.   I do not think you need to go back and get your high school.   If you've managed to use your brain to get a wealth of experience, and to achieve some amazing things, you are going to go far with it buddy!!   How many times do we hear stories about the immigrant with no education, or the corporate CEO without a university education, or the entrepreneur without high school who nailed it - and then some - in the business world.    You've done such a great job, and frankly, I really am proud of people like you.  Own that experience.  \n\n The shitty reality is there are some people who just can't see beyond a line on a resume.    But there are ways to compensate for that.    There is something out there called a [MOOC, Massive Open Online Courses.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course).  They are done online and there are many MOOC providers out there.   MOOC providers basically go to some of the most reputable universities on the planet, ask them to offer the public their courses online for a small fee to the public, and allow anyone to do them from home.  EdX and Coursera are two of the most famous ones, but there are others like Udacity or Udemy [and more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_MOOC_providers).   The cost is usually quite small, and you get a verifiable certificate issued by both the MOOC provider and the university once you finish and pass the course.   \n\n You can even do follow courses for free (called \u201cauditing\u201d), and decide later if you want to pay to get the certificate (with a payment deadline 1/3 of the way through the course, so you have to decide early).  But it\u2019s best to pay in my opinion (1) to have something to frame and show for your efforts, allowing you to say on your resum\u00e9 that you earned a certificate , and (2) so MOOCs and universities have revenue to continue to offer the world such great programs.\n\n Universities using MOOCs have now moved beyond just offering courses and are now offering various programs made up of several courses, called *Professional Certificate Programs*, sometimes *Micromasters* (about 15% of an actual real master's program, covering a specific interest sector, along with credit), and even full degrees (but the degrees do cost close to normal amounts).  You do NOT need any prior education to take these courses or programs.   I've taken MOOCs, and some of them are amazing.    \n\n If you really bust your butt every evening, a MOOC can be completed in 1/5 of the suggested time.  You'll see I stated \"6 months, via EdX\" for one of the MOOCs.  You can conceivably whittle that down to just 6 weeks if you work really hard, including the capstone project in which fellow online students offer peer reviews.    Frankly speaking, having a MOOC from Harvard, or Stanford, the London School of Economics, or Wharton (one of the world's best business schools), and taught by some of their most renowned professors, does look pretty good.   And you learn some great stuff... AND (the best part in my opinion), it show's you're a go-get'er who seeks to raise the bar, with attention paid to self-improvement and knowledge upgrading.\n\n If you have time to wait before you start applying for jobs, why not take two MOOCs over the next 1-3 months.  If you have 4-5 months to wait, then maybe take 3 (max).  It might make a difference for the caliber of job you can secure.   I mean, look at it on the mock resume I did for you... It does look pretty damn good (and there's no lying at all... I made sure to write \"via EdX\" or \"via Coursera\").    It makes for great conversation at interview (and the whole goal of the resume is to get you that interview so you can shine).\n\n Normally with other education a person doesn't need to put their high school degree on a resume.  But it could lead to questions if you have nothing for an education section.   However, if you put some some *relevant* and rather impressive looking MOOCs on your resume, they probably won't even ask about high school (and will just take it for granted you completed high school 15 years ago or something).   \n\n But if you can't wait to do a couple of MOOCs (even one) before your job hunt, I personally wouldn't put an education section on your resume, and would just let your experience and achievements speak for themselves (They can always ask you at interview if they're super curious, and they just might not ever ask.  You never know).\n\n Wanting to help you, I did some looking, and here are some current MOOCs which are open to enrollment which may be directly pertinent to your career (And remember, the time frames can be shortened to anywhere between 1/5 to 1/3 if you really work your butt off every evening for a few hours).  And they're from some pretty great universities with a prestigious factor that can only help: \n\n --- MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology): MicroMasters Program in Supply Chain Management (18 months, via EdX)\nhttps://www.edx.org/micromasters/mitx-supply-chain-management, $1500\n\n --- Univ. of Maryland:  Professional Certificate in Product Management (6 months, via EdX)  https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/usmx-product-management $890\n\n --- MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology): Certificate in Supply Chain Design (4 months, via EdX) https://www.edx.org/course/supply-chain-design $300\n \n --- Wharton Business School, Univ. of Pennsylvania:  Professional Certificate in Strategic Management (6 months, via EdX)\nhttps://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/wharton-strategic-management $535\n \n --- UC San Diego: Converting Challenges into Opportunities (One week development course, via Coursera)\nhttps://www.coursera.org/learn/converting-challenges-into-opportunities (Free until May 21, $300 after)\n\n --- London Business School, Univ. of London:  Managing the Company of the Future (6 weeks, via Coursera) https://www.coursera.org/learn/company-future-management Free until May 21, $300 after)\n\n --- Louvain University (France):  Supply Chain Management, A Decision-Making Framework (3 months, via EdX)\nhttps://www.edx.org/course/supply-chain-management-a-decision-making-framewor $50\n\n- Volunteer and Community Involvement:  Why did I add this?   At the beginning I stated that one of the things this resume was going to concentrate on (to detract from and to make up for the lack of a HS diploma or other education) was the *\"you-heavy factor - as someone who is a great guy and would be a wonderful corporate fit to have in the office.\"*.   When a person gets to a certain age, employers like to see they're hiring an engaged, pro-active, fits-well-in-the-community individual.   You're no longer a 21 year old who the organization feels they can mold into their image.  And so they want to see what kind of a molded person they're going to get.   If you've been engaged (perhaps volunteering with your kids sports teams, or if you belong to associations as a volunteer member, or anything), it can make them say *\"Hey this candidate seems like they're just an all-around great person, even without their excellent experience.  I betcha there's a chance they'd really fit in here with us and would be enjoyable to have around.  Let's call them to interview\"*.     It doesn't hurt... just 2, 3, maybe max 4 community involvement blurbs.  You don\u2019t have to put dates on them (that way you can list stuff you did even many years ago), and just run with it.  Is also good stuff which can keep the interview conversation flowing to develop even more rapport in the interview.\n\nThese are just some thoughts from a guy who wants to lend a hand.  Feel free to take and use any of this, or reject whatever you feel doesn't sit right for what you're trying to achieve.

It doesn't sound like it but it's worth asking.\n\nI like WGU, it's convenient, the all you can eat approach can be a great way of saving time and money IF you are able to get a lot of work done. If not, it's not that different than several other venues for price/time. Assuming you don't have a bachelors already  in a different field(in which case my advice changes)  I think the choice comes down to a) How self-directed are you? Are you the type of person that is happy to dive into a book or find an online course and learn something on your own? Or do you need structure? b) Which program interests you the most? Honestly content-wise the WGU program is a great checkbox and I am learning core CS content but it doesn't excite me. I do the classes and then spend time learning about topics that interest me outside of class. c) How much time can you realistically dedicate per week to this?\n\nThere are some other programs well worth considering as well. The Bachelors from the University of London on Coursera looks great to me and is certainly the degree that would probably intrigue most people. It also covers some neat topics. The exchange rate is better than it used to be so it's pretty well priced and British Bachelors are only 3 years so it's a bit faster that snhu. The program at SNHU looks cool on paper but it's going to take at least 4 years and be quite expensive unless you have transfer credits.\n\nHere's a list of programs I dug up for a similar post recently:\n\n[https://www.coursera.org/degrees/bachelor-of-science-computer-science-london](https://www.coursera.org/degrees/bachelor-of-science-computer-science-london)\n\n[https://www.tru.ca/distance/programs/technology/bachelor-of-computing-science.html](https://www.tru.ca/distance/programs/technology/bachelor-of-computing-science.html)\n\n[https://csuglobal.edu/undergraduate/bachelors-degrees/computer-science](https://csuglobal.edu/undergraduate/bachelors-degrees/computer-science)\n\n[https://www.herts.ac.uk/courses/bsc-hons-computer-science-online](https://www.herts.ac.uk/courses/bsc-hons-computer-science-online)\n\n[http://www.openuniversity.edu/courses/search-results/computing-and-it](http://www.openuniversity.edu/courses/search-results/computing-and-it)\n\n[https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/computer-science.html](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/computer-science.html)\n\n[https://www.snhu.edu/online-degrees/bachelors/bs-in-computer-science](https://www.snhu.edu/online-degrees/bachelors/bs-in-computer-science)\n\nThere are actually more programs than this, these are just the ones I could find in a brief search. I would suggest either looking at WGU is you are willing to dedicate a ton of time to studying and self-teaching to get it done fast. Otherwise, I'd say look at UofL on Coursera. Learn on the side and get it done over time. You don't really even need a degree in this industry. Just grab some books and some coursera courses, build some portfolio projects and start applying and you'll eventually find something. The degree won't hurt in the long run though.\n\nAgain if you have an existing Degree the advice changes. For the reference, I'll be finishing my degree in August after 18 months (+12 more if you count time spent in the marketing degree). I got a job as a software dev about 7 months ago now, thanks to WGU but also thanks to a ton of time spent learning and doing side projects.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1587777380, "gildings": {}, "id": "foi2i2e", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g5t6sb", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_g5t6sb", "permalink": "/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/g5t6sb/any_advice/foi2i2e/", "retrieved_on": 1587785900, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "WGU_CompSci", "subreddit_id": "t5_gsr7a", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1587777380.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "Gloomy-Ant", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_506b8hlj", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Take this course it's provided through McMaster University and it's free to enroll in; Learning how to Learn. \n\nhttps://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn\n\nI suggest you complete it or at least get through 75% of it, it consists of many small to large videos with some small readings,  but I assure you, after you take the course you'll have a better understanding of yourself and how to learn. \n\nTaking the course on its own, or use it in conjunction with some online classes highschool / community college / programming / or whatever else you want to focus on and learn about. \n\nThe course will explain the Pomodoro technique which in essence is focusing for 25 minutes straight with a 5 minute break, because focusing for only 25 minutes isn't hard you'll see after your break you'll want to go back to studying/writing, they delve into the technique in the course pretty extensively as well!

I think everyone has various happy moments throughout their day, big and small and it's all about how you react to them.  I think you can feel loved or be content, but sustaining happiness is something that's very difficult for most people because it involves being actively engaged in the moment.  Whether that's laughing, smiling, learning, working -- doing something -- new, fresh, engaging or exciting.  Giving a moment purpose, essentially. \n\n1.  Standard answer: Streaming (Netflix), Amazon (Prime), Hulu, Disney+ and other various services.  Try to watch stuff far outside of your interest range.  (Prime) also offers a variety of eBooks as does Kindle Unlimited which is a monthly service.  Both have some pretty solid offerings for reading material.  \n\n2.  Casual gaming; there are a lot of popular, well-received indie titles as of the last several years like Stardew Valley, Celeste, Terraria, Minecraft, JRPG's like Trails in the Sky, various older adventure games like The Secret of Monkey Island, and if you never played Portal 1/2 they're always a fun puzzle experience.  If you're curious about a game you can usually find someone on twitch.tv streaming it for viewers to watch/learn about. \n\n3.  Both Spotify/Pandora have decent music algorythms; filtering you music based on an artist or genre that you select.  You can link Spotify to social media and look through other people's playlists.  **Podcasts** are also another great, often under-utilized media option; it's good to hear people talk at times. \n\n4.  Cooking/Baking; it's a good time to learn how to make better home-cooked meals, utilize more spices, practice preparing vegetables in different ways.  Discovering or sharing recipes can also be fun as you can talk about how you modify recipes, experiment and the outcomes.  \n\n5.  Fitness, Stretching, Yoga, Home Workouts - They're a great way to empty your mind.  Meditation is a great way to manage stress; I've really come to believe in mindfulness over the last several weeks; being able to mentally kick-back away from your emotions and examine why you're feeling a certain way.  \n\n6.

There's something about picturing an urge like a wave, that will peak and pass, that helps me ride it out.\n\nAlso CalmHarm and CBT Toolbox have been helpful apps.\n\nOpen a window and let some light in.\n\nReach out to a friend. You don't have to talk about what's going on if you don't want to, just having a distraction helps. If you feel you're a little short on friends or like you can't open up to the ones you have, focus on building your support system wherever, however you can.\n\nLook for a support group. I found a 12-step program (Celebrate Recovery) invaluable. Having other people around who know what you're up against, who are willing to walk with you, can be a huge relief. Of course, it's harder right now to attend groups but you could probably find something online or reach out to a local chapter and see if they're streaming meetings. Many therapists are also offering phone or video sessions, worth looking around.\n\nDecide to watch something first, before hurting yourself. Ryan Hamilton on Netflix is hysterical.\n\nChange location. I'm less likely to hurt myself in public, even if that means taking a walk down the street or sitting on my porch. However if I'm feeling impulsive and unsafe (suicidal), I know I need to stay home and try a different approach or contact my therapist.\n\nAnother thing that helps me is to HALT (ask yourself if you are hungry, angry, lonely or tired, and if you are, address the immediate need). I also add an \"O\" for overwhelmed because I know I'm prone to self harm if I really need to take a break/step back from a situation, do some self care, or say no to someone. Just identifying what's going on can help you move through it.\n\nWhen I journal or write crappy poetry or a letter I won't send or do some art, it keeps my hands busy while I'm feeling the urge (which is good if you cut when you're bored, too), and it gives those feelings somewhere to go to be processed. Doesn't matter if the art was good or not because \"good\" wasn't the point, and so I affectionately refer to this as Shitty Art Tuesday, where things don't need to be perfect or good, just expressive. Helps the urge to be heard.\n\n[Box breathing and 54321 grounding](https://www.evergreenyfs.org/Youth%20Anxiety%20Handouts.pdf)\u00a0are worth a try. I always scoffed when someone suggested \"just breathe,\" because it seems dismissive, but then I actually tried it lol. With grounding, sometimes if I'm having a panic attack or if I'm dissociating, someone will do this with me and prompt me to focus, but I can also do it on my own.\n\nPut your feet in the grass and look up. Notice the flowers, rocks, whatever is in your yard. If you don't have a yard, notice whatever beautiful thing is around you.\n\nRemember it's okay to feel like doing something but then not do it. Just because it's on your mind doesn't mean you have to act. You're in charge. Of course, the other side to this is that you can choose to hurt yourself, too\n\nMake a self care kit. Lots of great ideas on pinterest.\n\nTalk back to the negative voice in your head. All it does is be mean and tell lies. It can f off.\n\nIf you have a library card and online access, check out some of the self harm workbooks available. Hope and Healing for Kids Who Cut by Marv Penner is a good book on self harm and I found it validating even as an adult. The Mindfulness Workbook for Teen Self Harm by Gina Biegel. If you've had any trauma in your life (a lot of us have), The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk and Complex PTSD by Pete Walker are eye opening. Of course there are lots of books on these topics, but all of these are on Hoopla.\n\nIf trauma is relevant to you, you can find a lot of support at r/cptsd (you don't have to have this diagnosis to join).\n\nTry something new. I've been learning to bake bread which is nice because kneading is cathartic and the results are yummy.\n\n[The Science of Well-Being](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being) Yale class - free\n\nWe all have a healthy and an unhealthy self and the one that grows is the one you feed.

Because that's really only 10-15% of CSE 6040, basicaly the numpy sections. The rest is just python and learning how to use the language and its relevant libraries (pandas and numpy).\n\nI took CSE 6040 before ISYE 6501 and even though I didn't have the background for some of the things we were doing (e.g., implementing PCA in python without understanding what PCA actually was), I still had very few problems with the course and found it relatively easy because I'm generally comfortable with python. Admittedly, I have familiarity with linear algebra from my undergrad years, so while I also found the numpy sections harder, I could still understand what's going on once I saw the solution and it easily 'clicked'.\n\nIf python/programming is your problem in general, then that's not necessarily good news because there's a lot of it in the program. But if you found ISYE 6501 easy, that also has a good amount of coding so I don't know...\n\nIf not understanding the concepts behind the programming is an issue, remember that CSE 6040's focus is more on building your programming proficiency than with teaching you the mathematical concepts (like I said, I implemented PCA with ease without understand what it actually meant).\n\nIf the linear algebra alone is the problem, then...mixed news for you. There are some courses, like Deterministic Optimisation, High Dimensional Data Analytics, Computational Data Analytics, which all require linear algebra knowledge as a prerequisite. There are probably a few others I haven't mentioned. You'd struggle with these. On the other hand, none of these are really compulsory (ISYE 6740 CDA is, but only if you're taking the computational analytics track) so you can avoid them and take courses without significant knowledge of linear algebra if you want, though linear algebra really does form the foundation of a lot of data science because of its ability to quickly process information without running full-blown for loops so you'll likely encounter it again in different places.\n\nIt's just knowledge like any other, though. I've found that linear algebra is often taught in an obtuse manner, where the focus is more on the mechanical operations than the actual intuition and meaning behind those operations (e.g., how to find the inverse of a matrix instead of what the inverse means and why you'd want to use it in solving real problems). I've found that once you understand that intuition, linear algebra is generally kinda easy, but if it's not taught properly and all you learn is those mechanical operations and how to do them, you can easily start getting headaches.\n\nBut there are good courses that can help you get up to speed.

The 3blue1brown videos will give you the intuition for what different LA  operations are all about and the Coursera specialisation will reinforce this and teach how to compute (and program) them. Then, go back to the 3blue1brown videos to reinforce that intuition of what all those mechanical operations you learned to perform are actually useful for. If you do just these two, you should have at least a good foundation for OMSA. You can refer to the textbook if you want as well to build out your knowledge more formally.\n\nIf you want to learn even more/with more academic rigour, the LAFF courses have an excellent reputation and there are three follow-on courses for even more advanced linear algebra if you want to do that. Alternatively, you can also follow the MIT lectures. Gilbert Strang is the author of one of the most popular LA textbooks out there, so you know you're in good hands.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1587326301, "edited": 1587327191.0, "gildings": {}, "id": "fnwvkr3", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_g4dh5l", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_g4dh5l", "permalink": "/r/OMSA/comments/g4dh5l/how_representative_is_cse_6040_of_the_other_omsa/fnwvkr3/", "retrieved_on": 1587327327, "score": 3, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "OMSA", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ihhi", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1587326301.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "my_password_is______", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_srbgb", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "in order\n                              \n\n\n-----------------------                     \nhttps://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning\n\nDeep Learning Specialization\n\n5 course specialization  \n\n* Neural Networks and Deep Learning\n* Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization\n* Structuring Machine Learning Projects\n* Convolutional Neural Networks\n* Sequence Models\n\nIn five courses, you will learn the foundations of Deep Learning, understand how to build neural networks, and learn how to lead successful machine learning projects. You will learn about Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more. You will work on case studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing. You will master not only the theory, but also see how it is applied in industry. You will practice all these ideas in Python and in TensorFlow, which we will teach.\n\n---------------------                  \nhttps://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice\n\nTensorFlow in Practice Specialization\n\n4 course specialization    \n\n* Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning\n* Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow\n* Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow\n* Sequences, Time Series and Prediction\n\nIn this four-course Specialization, you\u2019ll explore exciting opportunities for AI applications. Begin by developing an understanding of how to build and train neural networks. Improve a network\u2019s performance using convolutions as you train it to identify real-world images. You\u2019ll teach machines to understand, analyze, and respond to human speech with natural language processing systems. Learn to process text, represent sentences as vectors, and input data to a neural network. You\u2019ll even train an AI to create original poetry!\n\n---------------------                     \nhttps://www.coursera.org/specializations/ai-for-medicine          \n\nAI for Medicine Specialization\n\n3 course specialization                         \n\n* AI for Medical Diagnosis\n* AI for Medical Prognosis\n* AI For Medical Treatment\n\n* In Course 1, you will create convolutional neural network image classification and segmentation models to make diagnoses of lung and brain disorders. \n* In Course 2, you will build risk models and survival estimators for heart disease using statistical methods and a random forest predictor to determine patient prognosis. \n* In Course 3, you will build a treatment effect predictor, apply model interpretation techniques and use natural language processing to extract information from radiology reports.\n\nYou don't need to be an AI expert, but a working knowledge of deep neural networks, particularly convolutional networks, and proficiency in Python programming at an intermediate level will be essential.

It can be good in a way though, depending on what your family is like... healing can be easier with a little family distance sometimes.

There's something about picturing an urge like a wave, that will peak and pass, that helps me ride it out.\n\nAlso CalmHarm and CBT Toolbox have been helpful apps.\n\nOpen a window and let some light in.\n\nReach out to a friend. You don't have to talk about what's going on if you don't want to, just having a distraction helps. If you feel you're a little short on friends or like you can't open up to the ones you have, focus on building your support system wherever, however you can.\n\nLook for a support group. I found a 12-step program (Celebrate Recovery) invaluable. Having other people around who know what you're up against, who are willing to walk with you, can be a huge relief. Of course, it's harder right now to attend groups but you could probably find something [online](https://www.facebook.com/PromiseResourceNetwork/?eid=ARDQk0D8M8Z8PG0RTXszE0oUwGUYQwrUaGwAp2JJKj_Q9GPerkMv_xxzxm0MwIPdq1U1FVycZhmSNhWZ) or reach out to a local chapter and see if they're streaming meetings. Many therapists are also offering phone or video sessions, worth looking around.\n\nDecide to watch something first, before hurting yourself. Ryan Hamilton on Netflix is hysterical.\n\nChange location. I'm less likely to hurt myself in public, even if that means taking a walk down the street or sitting on my porch. However if I'm feeling impulsive and unsafe (suicidal), I know I need to stay home and try a different approach or contact my therapist.\n\nAnother thing that helps me is to HALT (ask yourself if you are hungry, angry, lonely or tired, and if you are, address the immediate need). I also add an \"O\" for overwhelmed because I know I'm prone to self harm if I really need to take a break/step back from a situation, do some self care, or say no to someone. Just identifying what's going on can help you move through it.\n\nWhen I journal or write crappy poetry or a letter I won't send or do some art, it keeps my hands busy while I'm feeling the urge, and it gives those feelings somewhere to go to be processed. Doesn't matter if the art was good or not because \"good\" wasn't the point, and so I affectionately refer to this as Shitty Art Tuesday, where things don't need to be perfect or good, just expressive. Helps the urge to be heard.\n\n[Box breathing and 54321 grounding](https://www.evergreenyfs.org/Youth%20Anxiety%20Handouts.pdf)\u00a0are worth a try. I always scoffed when someone suggested \"just breathe,\" because it seems dismissive, but then I actually tried it lol. With grounding, sometimes if I'm having a panic attack or if I'm dissociating, someone will do this with me and prompt me to focus, but I can also do it on my own.\n\nPut your feet in the grass and look up. Notice the flowers, rocks, whatever is in your yard. If you don't have a yard, notice whatever beautiful thing is around you.\n\nRemember it's okay to feel like doing something but then not do it. Just because it's on your mind doesn't mean you have to act. You're in charge. Of course, the other side to this is that you can choose to hurt yourself, too\n\nMake a self care kit. Lots of great ideas on pinterest.\n\nTalk back to the negative voice in your head. All it does is be mean and tell lies. It can f off.\n\nIf you have a library card and online access, check out some of the self harm workbooks available. Hope and Healing for Kids Who Cut by Marv Penner is a good book on self harm and I found it validating even as an adult. The Mindfulness Workbook for Teen Self Harm by Gina Biegel. If you've had any trauma in your life (a lot of us have), The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk and Complex PTSD by Pete Walker are eye opening. Of course there are lots of books on these topics, but all of these are on Hoopla.\n\nIf trauma is relevant to you, you can find a lot of support at r/cptsd (you don't have to have this diagnosis to join).\n\nTry something new. I've been learning to bake bread which is nice because kneading is cathartic and the results are yummy.\n\n[The Science of Well-Being](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being) Yale class - free\n\nIt can take 5-10 good coping skills to replace 1 bad one and nothing will feel the same. Nothing will be so instantly gratifying- that's okay, it doesn't need to be. Different skills work for different situations. It's more about creating time and space between urge and action, to slow the roll. Every time you make that choice, you stretch that muscle. It also helps strengthen healthy neuropathways, and the more you practice the more the old pathways grow over. We all have a healthy and an unhealthy self and the one that grows is the one you feed. Creating space gives your healthy self a chance to grow.\n\nI'm sure you know that self harm is a symptom. It helps to address the root issue, which can take a lot of time and effort to figure out. That's okay. You don't even have to want to stop to start recovery- you just have to not like where you're at. Be patient with yourself.

You have to draw a tomato somewhere for every block of focused work that you complete. You could try using apps like forest, although I would recommend going the analog way on a sheet of paper.\n\nWhen you encounter a big problem that you can't digest, you need to take it slowly and identify the smaller things you don't understand and start tackling them one by one.\n\nAlso, when studying is important to take notes. For programming I recommend the Notion app. The desktop application is great and it sincronizes with your phone.\nThat way you can keep lots of examples and notes for you to go back to when you want to do something on your own.\n\nI recommend you check a course called, \"Learning how to learn\" by McMaster University, on Coursera.

Here are my thoughts. \n\n1.  Nothing lasts forever.  Our time on Earth is limited.  People get older, graduate, move away.  You meet people, love people, lose people -- it is all worth it so you can be there for someone that needs you.  Be kind to yourself and be the sort of person that gets into the habit of doing their future self favors.  \n\n2.  Ask yourself whether the things you want (and the people you want to be around) are getting closer or are slowly getting further away.  In my case, big part of motivation for exercise is the latter.  I don't want to feel so strained or tired from going between classes on campus and so on.  \n\n3.  Try to focus less on the \"product\" of an action or habit and more on the process.  So, I'm working on various exercises; back, core, legs, shoulders, biceps/triceps; rather than focusing on 6 months from now I'm focus on how the exercise feels, my form, my comfort level with the resistance/weight. \n\n4.  Build a schedule; do things more or less at the same time of day.  Eat well.  Drink a lot of water, take it easy on the caffeine/coffee/energy-drinks.  If you like reading, read.  If you like creating, create.  \n\n5.  Find a way to either exercise or socialize; these are key to generating new neurons.  [Consider taking some free university classes.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn?) You can condition yourself so that \"tough\" or \"challenging\" tasks are seen as \"painful\" and giving up that pain for pleasure is addicting.  I'm about half done with the learning ^ class; it's a bunch of videos and some fairly easy quizzes.  \n\n6.  Try to look at things as an opportunity and a privilege.  You don't \"have\" to do anything.  However, when you change your inner-dialogue from, \"I have to take out the trash,\" to \"I get to take out the trash,\" (or whatever) it puts thing into perspective; I'm not worried about shelter, food -- I \"get\" to work-out -- on the new exercise equipment -- meaning I don't have to go to the gym.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1585960752, "gildings": {}, "id": "fmd7128", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fujr7t", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_fujr7t", "permalink": "/r/CasualConversation/comments/fujr7t/yall_got_any_spare_motivation/fmd7128/", "retrieved_on": 1585962238, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "CasualConversation", "subreddit_id": "t5_323oy", "total_awards_received": 0, "created": 1585960752.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "Studio_7", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_11fqh4", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Always happy to help!\n\nCoursera has a great git course - you only have to pay if you want the certificate, which you won't need: [https://www.coursera.org/lecture/version-control-with-git/devops-and-git-in-a-nutshell-ySzMb](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/version-control-with-git/devops-and-git-in-a-nutshell-ySzMb)\n\nFor static sites, I suggest GitLab because I find it more full-featured than GitHub (there's a comparison out there if you care to research it). You could also use Atlassian's BitBucket. Really any cloud git repo where you can have your host pull the data from. I got on GitLab initially because GitHub didn't use to offer private repositories for free (they do now), but after using both, lab is better for professional projects IMO.\n\nYou don't have to use Netlify - there's also Zeit, and a platform called Surge dot sh  (for some reason reddit doesn't like the direct link to Surge) or if you go the AWS route you can always just host it on an S3 bucket!\n\nBut if you end up learning modern SSG - using tools like Gatsby or Gridsome - you'll want to use Netlify.\n\nFor AWS - just a clarification: Bitnami offers a preconfigured AMI that is ready for a (mostly) plug and play wordpress site. That will give you what's called an 'EC2 Instance'\n\nTo give you an idea of the hierarchy: AWS is the provider, EC2 is the service for cloud computing, EC2 instances are individual virtual servers, they are provisioned using AMIs, and Bitnami is a company specializing in open-sourced packaging and distribution of software, and they provide a preconfigured AMI that spins up a EC2 instance ready for wordpress.\n\nYou could possibly use that instance for multiple, but given that you said it was a pretty heavy site, I would keep it on a t3.nano or .micro instance by itself (those are the sizes of EC2 instances, it determines the resources each one is allocated, and, of course, the price :P)\n\nTo host multiple, I would recommend learning how to set up and admin your own EC2 instance. That will be selecting the OS, learning how to SSH in, setting up the server environment, the firewall (honestly, this is way easier than people think it is), the webserver (I'll recommend NGINX, but it's personal preference between that and Apache), and once that's done, you have yourself a functioning webserver.\n\nAt this point, I would make and save your own private AMI for your preconfigured, ready to go webserver.\n\nFrom there, you'll need to learn how to create a database, create a directory for your site, have your webserver point to your website's directory, navigate to your site over the web, and then you just follow the install like you normally would using the database credentials of the DB that you created! Rinse and repeat these steps for each additional site. Eventually you'll need to either 1) increase the server size (easy to do, 1. create AMI, 2. spin up new server with more resources than the old one using that AMI, 3. reassign your IP to that new server), or 2) you can just use that AMI we created of your boilerplate webserver and go from there!\n\nThat's glossing over a lot of the best practices, failover, backups, remote dbs (HIGHLY recommend using AWS RDS (remote database service) - this way your data is decoupled from your application server, so if anything happens to the compute side, you may have your site go down, but you don't lose your content!)\n\nThat's a LOT to throw at you, but that should be enough to keep you occupied for at least the weekend :P\n\nShoot me a PM or a chat - as much as I love being outside that's not really possible right now so I'm spending time between projects to help people out and I'd be more than happy to help you with any questions you might have along the way!", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1585951292, "gildings": {}, "id": "fmcrd0r", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fuemm3", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_fmcgv47", "permalink": "/r/webdev/comments/fuemm3/what_is_the_best_domainhostingssl_company/fmcrd0r/", "retrieved_on": 1585953631, "score": 2, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "webdev", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs0q", "total_awards_received": 0, "created": 1585951292.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "fallintoabyss1", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3epw6iiv", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "You might want to check out some of Barbara Oakley's books, such as 'Learning how to learn', 'mind shift' and I think she has a study tips book as well. \n\nAlso you might be able to get free Coursera course on learning how to learn\n\nhttps://www.classcentral.com/course/learning-how-to-learn-2161\n\nhttps://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn#about", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1585772451, "gildings": {}, "id": "fm5gdsd", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ft57pb", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_fm5cil9", "permalink": "/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/ft57pb/do_you_ever_wonder_how_much_you_werent_taught/fm5gdsd/", "retrieved_on": 1585775942, "score": 3, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "TooAfraidToAsk", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ssp7", "total_awards_received": 0, "created": 1585772451.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "ManwithPrinciples", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_u38jw", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "I also recommend Coursera's [\"Learning how to learn\"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn).
