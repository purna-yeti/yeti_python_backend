This is by no means comprehensive, but should provide a good starting point to an computer engineering student/professional that wants to learn more about the subject.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Books:**\n\n* **Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface**\n   * A good first book in computer architecture written by two famous architects. This book provides a great foundation for more advanced topics, and comes in many versions (including a more recent on that uses RISC V). Many undergraduate programs use this book for an undergraduate architecture course.\n* **Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach**\n   * If you're interested in diving deeper into architecture, this book is commonly used as a graduate text on the subject. It dives into more advanced topics like out-of-order execution, a more detailed look at the memory system, and some introductory information on more parallel/vector architectures.\n* **Parallel Computer Architecture: A Hardware/Software Approach**\n   * This book introduces some of the more difficult problems in computer architecture, including memory consistency and cache coherence, and interconnection networks. If you really want to know how multi-core architectures function, this is a good starting point.\n\n**Online Courses:**\n\n* **Onur Mutlu's Design of Digital Circuits course on YouTube**\n   * An introduction to computer architecture from one of the top architects in the field\n   * [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5Q2soXY2Zi\\_QedyPWtRmFUJ2F8DdYP7l](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5Q2soXY2Zi_QedyPWtRmFUJ2F8DdYP7l) \n* **Onur Mutlu's Computer Architecture course on YouTube**\n   * A more graduate-level course from Onur\n   * [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5Q2soXY2Zi9JXe3ywQMhylk\\_d5dI-TM7](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5Q2soXY2Zi9JXe3ywQMhylk_d5dI-TM7)\n* **David Wentzlaff's Coursera Computer Architecture Course**\n   * Another more graduate-level course from another top computer architect in the field\n   * [https://www.coursera.org/instructor/\\~419989](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/~419989)\n* **Kayvon Fatahalian's page with many course and links**\n   * [http://graphics.stanford.edu/\\~kayvonf/](http://graphics.stanford.edu/~kayvonf/)\n* **Onur Mutlu's Page with many courses and links**\n   * [https://people.inf.ethz.ch/omutlu/teaching.html](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/omutlu/teaching.html)\n\n**Research:**\n\n* It's important to at least know the top conferences that architects generally target for publications. \n   * **ISCA** (International Symposium on Computer Architecture)\n   * **MICRO** (International Symposium on Microarchitecture)\n   * **ASPLOS** (International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems)\n   * **HPCA** (International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture)\n   * **SC** (The International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis)\n\n**More Advanced Topics (free to download on many university networks):**\n\n* **The Synthesis Lectures on Computer Architecture**\n   * Compact books that provide good introductions into specific areas of computer architecture. You can find resources on GPGPU architecture, On-Chip networks, Deep Learning architectures, and much more!\n   * [https://www.morganclaypool.com/toc/cac/1/1](https://www.morganclaypool.com/toc/cac/1/1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's all for now. I'll try to update/revise this as time goes on, and if I feel there's another resource that should be highlighted.

In summary, I\u2019m green.\n\nMy target is Cambridge MPhil in Computational Biology in 2021/22. Not having a computer science or mathematical undergrad background, I'm aiming to have a solid foundation so this is a 2 year project.\n\nMy biggest concern is stats- the OSSU curriculum has college

The job requirements are broadly similar, but my department is expanding towards data analytics. Coming from literally 0 programming knowledge, I researched online and Python seems to be one of the more popular programming languages used for data analytics.\n\n___\n**Readings &amp; Practicing**\n\nI started learning the basic of Pythons with [Coursera's Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python). This gave me a fundamental understanding of Python and it's capabilities. \n\nUpon completion, I started viewing Corey Schafer's videos on YouTube. I have also enrolled in edx's [MIT's Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.00.1x+2T2019a/course/) which started this week.\n\nAfter speaking to my manager, he recommended me to first understand the fundamentals behind data science and understand the scientific approaches to learning from data and using it to tell the story. \n\nTo start off he recommended Coursera's course on [Basic statistics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/basic-statistics). After which, he recommended me to combine what I've learnt and embark on [Statistics with Python](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics-with-python).\n\nAll of this is overwhelming as I find myself jumping back and forth between learning Python and Statistics. If I were to focus on Statistics, how in-depth (Advanced Statistics?) do I have to go before embarking on Python?\n\nAny comments is greatly appreciated!
