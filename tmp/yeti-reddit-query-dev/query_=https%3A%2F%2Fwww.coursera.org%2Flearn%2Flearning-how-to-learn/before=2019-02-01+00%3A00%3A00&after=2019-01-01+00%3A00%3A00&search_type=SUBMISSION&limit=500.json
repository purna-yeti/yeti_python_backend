I have several questions throughout this post but any input is appreciated!\n\nI'm 29, graduated about 8 years ago with 2 Bachelor's degrees - a B.S. in Biology and a B.A. in Philosophy. While I have a science background it was not particularly math intensive, being bio.\n\nMy entire career since I've graduated has actually been in IT/technology, though. For the last two years I've worked as a  systems engineer, architecting things on AWS. I have a couple AWS certs. I'm pretty good at what I do. I am an intermediate programmer, mostly Python, but I have a lot to learn still. I love programming and computers and I am seriously considering a Master's degree to take the next step - I'd like to get out of the operations side of things and into a more development focused role (or maybe even make a move into something more scientific/computational eventually - I don't fully know yet TBH). My biggest gap to fill will be the math side of things.\n\nSo my question is how to go about doing this. I've taken some online compsci courses in the past from Udacity (Android development for beginners). I am currently working through this specialization on Coursera ([https://www.coursera.org/specializations/computer-fundamentals](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/computer-fundamentals)). I am getting a lot out of the Coursea specialization, really enjoying it (the coursework is created by Rice university and is equivalent to their 1st year compsci undergrad coursework). Is this kind of self-learning worthwhile, or would I be better off looking for something that actually results in transferable credits if I actually want to get admitted to a program?\n\nI'm primarily interested in going with an online master's program. I see that coursera offers one ([https://www.coursera.org/degrees/master-of-computer-science-illinois#admissions](https://www.coursera.org/degrees/master-of-computer-science-illinois#admissions)) that doesn't require a CS background, just a bachelor's in any field - is that too good to be true? How do you evaluate online CS master's programs? Are there any standouts considered the best?\n\nFinally, on the math side of things, I have basically 1 year of college level \"short calculus\" and a basic college level statistics class. What math courses would you recommend for me to take to shore up my math background to improve my application for a master's program?\n\nThanks for any advice!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "cscareerquestions", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpm", "subreddit_subscribers": 210823, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Considering a CS master's, without formal CS background", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/akkl85/considering_a_cs_masters_without_formal_cs/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1548655473.0}, {"author": "InterestedSpectator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_e44mi", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1548313711, "domain": "self.TEFL", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/comments/aj9xnw/professional_development_for_esl_teachers/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "aj9xnw", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 20, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/TEFL/comments/aj9xnw/professional_development_for_esl_teachers/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1548313712, "score": 1, "selftext": "I'm finally going to do a CELTA after teaching for nearly four years with just an unrelated degree and a few days initial training. I haven't had any professional development or training since then. While trying to figure out what I want to do next, I've been looking up what other professional development opportunities I can pursue  over the next few years before deciding whether I want to go down the DELTA, PGCE or Masters route. Below is what I've come across so far. Does anybody have anything to amend or add? Or have any experiences of the lesser known courses and if you've found them worthwhile or useful?\n\n\nINITIAL TEACHER TRAINING\n\n\nCELTA - The most widely recognised initial TEFL certification offered by Cambridge. Offered worldwide, are usually a 1 month intensive course and costs anywhere from \u20ac1100-2500 depending on location. Some centres offer a part time or online/blended option.\n\nhttps://www.cambridgeenglish.org/teaching-english/teaching-qualifications/celta/\n\n\nCertTESOL - The alternative to CELTA offered by Trinity College London. Similar price and format, 130 hours compared to 120 for CELTA. Some comments say it has a bit more content aimed at young learners than the CELTA\n\nhttps://www.trinitycollege.com/site/?id=201\n\n\n\nDELTA - A diploma in ESL teaching and the next step after the CELTA. It consists of 3 modules that are standalone and can be taken together or separately. Some universities accept it as credit towards a Masters degree. Module 1 assessment is an exam and Module 3 is an assignment so can be studied online, module 2 consists of teaching practice and continuous assessment. Intensive courses for the 3 modules are usually run over 8+ weeks and prices seem to range from \u20ac3200-5000 including assessment fees. As well as improving teaching skills, it seems to be geared towards people who are looking to move into teacher training, management, publishing or director of studies type roles.\n\n\nDipTESOL - The DELTA equivalent from Trinity and consists of 4 units. Unit 1 assessment is an exam, unit 2 a portfolio, unit 3 an interview on phonetics and phonology, and unit 4 is assessed on 5 observed teaching practices. Full time courses last 10-12 weeks but online blended options are also available. Prices and outcomes are similar to the DELTA.\n\n\nYOUNG LEARNERS\n\n\nTYLEC - Young learners certificate offered by Trinity as an extension to the CELTA/CertTESOL, meaning you must have done one of these certifications or equivalent as a prerequisite. The only young learners cert offered by an accredited institution since Cambridge stopped offering the CELTA-YL extension. Courses generally seem to be 2 or 3 week intensive courses or extensive courses spread over a number of months. Finding it hard to get information on courses but the prices I've seen are \u20ac1000+. The website lists numerous centers permitted to offer the course, but it seems very few of them are currently running it.\n\nhttps://www.trinitycollege.com/site/?id=3206\n\n\nIH CYLT - Another 2 week intensive course, offered by International House. Courses are run once or twice a year by a number of centers around the world, and prices seem to range from \u20ac600-800. The certificate is issued by International House London but also includes a moderated by Cambridge stamp.\n\nhttps://ihworld.com/teach/improve-your-teaching-skills/ih-certificate-in-teaching-young-learners-and-teenagers/\n\n\n\nBUSINESS ENGLISH\n\n\nFTBE - Certificate issued by the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI). This is gained by passing an exam so various providers have different ways of offering the course, from a week long prepartion course to part time over the space of a few months. I've seen prices from \u20ac300-600.\n\nhttps://qualifications.pearson.com/en/qualifications/lcci/english-language/teachers-of-business-english-ftbe.html\n\n\nCert IBET - Certificate jointly validated by Trinity and English UK. A two week (50 hour) course plus a post course assignment of 3000-5000 words that has be submitted within 3 months of the course end date. The prices I've seen vary from \u20ac1000-1500 and there are also online and online/blended options. This would seem to be the most comprehensive of the business English certificates\n\nhttps://www.trinitycollege.com/site/?id=1469\n\nhttps://www.englishuk.com/en/training/qualifications/cert-ibet\n\n\nIH BET - The general consensus is that Business English certificates are pretty much unknown and rare, but the 2 above are the most well known. International House also offers their own and seems to have switched to a completely online course, despite listing a number of centers running it as a face to face course. Price is listed as \u00a3552 for non IH staff and the site mentions that it helps prepare candidates for the FTBE exam.\n\nhttps://ihworld.com/teach/ih-online-teacher-training/ih-certificate-in-teaching-business-english/\n\n\nOTHER\n\n\nIH VYL - An online certificate from International House for teaching very young learners (2-6). 50 hour course spread out of 10 weeks plus another 2 weeks to complete an assignment. At \u00a3540 it seems to be expensive but claims to be unique in what it's offering.\n\n\nIH 121 - Another IH course that seems to have moved fully online and aimed at teachers looking to teach 1-2-1. It also claims to provide the background needed for a teacher specialising in 121 for the DELTA module 3. At \u00a3528 it looks expensive.\n\n\nCert ICT - Certificate in Teaching Languages with Technology. This was previously jointly offered by Trinity and The Consultants-E but from 2019 is only offered by The Consultants-E as an on demand course and requires 6 or more participants to run. It consists of 3 modules run over 26 weeks and costs \u00a3970.\n\nhttps://www.theconsultants-e.com/training/online/certict/\n\n\nCLIL course - Content and Language Integrated Learning courses for teachers who teach other subjects through English. There are various providers, some online and some in person for 2 week intensive courses. I've seen prices from around \u20ac400-1900. \n\n\nJolly Phonics - Jolly Phonics seems to be one of the most widely known phonics systems out there. Their website offers a 20 hour online training course for \u00a389 or 2 day face to face courses. I'm not sure how worthwhile it is doing this if you're not going to be teaching Jolly Phonics programme after the course though.\n\nhttps://www.jollylearning.co.uk/training/\n\n\nIELTS/Exams - Cambridge offers a 20 hour online module on teaching IELTS on their site, for $26, as well as individual modules on teaching the Cambridge curriculum. The IELTS website also contains information on becoming an IELTS examiner. Oxford TEFL offers a 30 hour online course on teaching IELTS for \u20ac350, as well as courses in teaching Cambridge exams and English for Academic Purposes, also  \u20ac350.\n\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/us/cambridgeenglish/teacher-development/teaching-ielts\n\nhttps://www.ielts.org/en-us/teaching-and-research/examiner-recruitment-and-training\n\nhttps://www.oxfordtefl.com/oxford-tefl-courses/teacher-development/teaching-ielts\n\n\nGoogle Certified Educator - Not directly related to ESL but some job ads do ask for computer literate candidates. The Level 1 exam costs $10, level 2 costs $25. After that there's the opportunity to became a Google Certified Trainer which involves submitting a video and application to google.\n\nhttps://teachercenter.withgoogle.com/certification_level1\n\n\nFREE COURSES\n\n\nThe British Council has a series of short term courses on futurelearn\n\nhttps://www.futurelearn.com/partners/british-council\n\nThis teaching reading course on coursera has good feedback on an old reddit thread\n\nhttps://www.coursera.org/learn/esl-reading", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "TEFL", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qq76", "subreddit_subscribers": 27086, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Professional Development for ESL teachers", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/comments/aj9xnw/professional_development_for_esl_teachers/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1548313711.0}, {"author": "Massnsen", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_10h96aey", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1547592249, "domain": "self.googlecloud", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/googlecloud/comments/agecc1/resources_to_learn_gcp/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "agecc1", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/googlecloud/comments/agecc1/resources_to_learn_gcp/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1547592251, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello Guys,\n\nI recently accepted a job ( junior Data Engineer) in a company that uses  GCP services : BigQuery, GCS, Composer, Cloud Build ...etc. \n\nIt's my first time with cloud services and I want to learn the fundamentals.
