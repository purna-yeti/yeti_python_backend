I have concise lists for how I want to work, learn, communicate, etc.) that I try to review (and update, if needed) regularly and (ideally) visualize myself implementing (it's a training trick that's actively used even in sports psychology). // The Checklist Manifesto is a good book about checklists, by the way. \n* A structured list, \"Achievements/credentials\", for multiple types of stuff that I finish/achieve (e.g. a finished deck of Memrise cards for cognitive biases). \n\n**Effective &amp; efficient learning is a good meta skill to have.**\n\n1.

That advice is based on neuroscience research and in the course materials the lecturers provide links to the supporting research studies.\n\n**Building habits effectively &amp; efficiently is another good meta skill.**\n\nAtomic Habits by James Clear is a go-to book about it these days. It merges info from all previous bestsellers/reputable books about habit building. Here are the most useful blog posts form his site that are kind of excerpts from the book:\n\n* https://jamesclear.com/identity-based-habits\n* https://jamesclear.com/habit-guide\n* https://jamesclear.com/akrasia (the section called The Framework You Need to Beat Procrastination)\n* https://jamesclear.com/three-steps-habit-change // The thing that isn't obvious there is that it can feel like a sufficient enough *reward* to\u2026\n  * \u2026 put a *checkmark* in your habit trackers in your bujo OR fill in the circle/cell of your habit tracker with *green* color (green color feels joyful &amp; nourishing &amp; is quite relevant to that quote, *\"Don\u2019t judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant.\"),* with a normal ballpoint pen instead of, say, a thick marker, because slow hatching with a ballpoint pen creates some kind of mindful savoring experience; \n  * \u2026AND not to break the continuous chain of checkmarks/circles for that habit (or don't break the rule of no more than 2 skipped days in a row).  \n  * There are, inevitably, some days when you are *low-functioning* and don't have enough mental power for high aspirations *(i.e. for motivating yourself with your values/desired identity),* and in such case the reward of adding a completion mark to your habit trackers, the reward of NOT breaking the chain of successful habit completions can be a simple &amp; tangible enough reason for your temporarily-low-functioning mind to get motivated &amp; do the habit.  \n\n**Habit tracking can be helpful OR detrimental though.** I've found that it's really helpful to pause &amp; savor how it feels, having completed the habit BEFORE adding completion info to the habit trackers.

Are you interested in learning just for your own satisfaction... or to pass some exam, access university? If that's the case, just following a course of Khan Academy may not be enough to guarantee your success in passing college exams, you will need good LEARNING STRATEGIES.\n\nMy case is a bit similar to yours (except I didn\u2019t abuse any substance). I decided to start engineering at 34 years of age. I\u2019d say I forgot more than 90% of what I had learned in high school\u2026 I couldn\u2019t even solve the simplest math problems, forgot all Chemistry and Physics\u2026\n\nTo relearn all that, I watched hundreds of video lessons in youtube\u2026 I tried lots of different methods. I can tell you the most inefficient methods:\n\n* just watch lessons\n* just read\n* just take notes\n* just solve problems, go ahead and never go back to that content\n\nIn other words: PASSIVE LEARNING is very inefficient, big waste of time. You can watch a whole series of Khan Academy, spend perhaps 100 hours to complete one course, you may have the illusion you are learning a lot\u2026 But without intense practice and reviewing, you may forget most things very soon.\n\nIf you really want to learn, you can\u2019t ignore THE FORGETTING CURVE: after just one hour, your brain will be able to retain less than 50% of the content without reviewing. After one month, you will remember mere 15% of the content. \n\nBut there is a magic to fight the forgetting curve: Anki - it\u2019s the most used memorization app in Engineering, Medicine and Languages. You can enter all your notes there and it will organize systematic reviews using spaced repetition considering the forgetting curve.\n\nAnki is the thing that is helping me the most.\n\nSo before you start a big study project, first search a bit about how you can learn, study, etc. There is a great course called \u201cLearning how to learn\u201d.\n\n[https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)\n\nAnki Tutorial: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K2StK7e3ww&amp;list=PL2ADAFpTg5aYuGojjD\\_O0mU1uml7Plw2Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K2StK7e3ww&amp;list=PL2ADAFpTg5aYuGojjD_O0mU1uml7Plw2Q)", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1601423363, "gildings": {}, "id": "g74byck", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_j24tzr", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_j24tzr", "permalink": "/r/khanacademy/comments/j24tzr/relearning_school_by_watching_every_video_and/g74byck/", "retrieved_on": 1601431803, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "khanacademy", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rop8", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1601423363.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "CynicalSamaritan", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_29okvbwr", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Most people will recommend either JavaScript (which is a coding language used commonly in web applications) or Python (which is a popular interpreted language used for scripting) as your first language. It doesn't really matter what language is your first coding language, just stick to 1 until you've learned the basics and completed some projects. Python (and R) are widely used in data analysis and scientific computing, so that might be what I would point to you to. \n\nAs a follow-on online course, I'd recommend EdX's [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7), which uses Python. This course, similar to Harvard's CS50 is more focused on computer science and how to think like a programmer, but tends to hold your hand less and it uses solely Python; CS50 uses a wide variety of languages to give you an overview. Similar to using a computer, quite a bit of coding is about learning to use Google or read the documentation to figure things out (and why they're not working). The skills or ways of thinking that you pick up by learning coding/computer science are helpful in general even outside of the coding context.\n\nProgrammers recommend an intro to computer science type course because the focus isn't to teach you how to code (although you will do that) but the core skills of how to think like a programmer. When you're learning to cook and trying to follow a recipe, terms like \"saute\" or \"mince\" or \"dice\" don't mean anything to you. Similarly, a good comp sci intro course will give you the building blocks/principles and help you use those while learning how to code. If you can finish either this course or CS50, I would say you would have a solid foundation for learning how to code and can start to try using the coding language in your everyday work. \n\nIt's really helpful to find and code projects that interest you as that it is what helps you develop proficiency and go from a beginner to an expert; courses often hold your hand by giving you exercises, sometimes with pre-written code to help you, so coding your own projects requires that you think through how to code something. I recommend the above course because it takes a project oriented approach to assignments and the assignments are really hard because they require you to think for yourself and try out code until you figure it out on your own. \n\n[FreeCodeCamp](http://freecodecamp.org/), which has been suggested elsewhere, focuses on HTML/CSS/Javascript and would be an excellent curriculum to follow if you want to learn to develop a web or mobile app. They also have recently launched their Python curriculum, which is based on Charles Severance's [Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/book.php) book and online course (available on [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python)), which are very beginner friendly. If you learn Python, I'd recommend the free book [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter0/) for suggestions on how to use Python to automate routine tasks. For example, I've used PyXl to automate a lot of Excel related spreadsheet work that I do. You can also use either of the 2 books I mentioned as introductory Python books as well.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1601414663, "gildings": {}, "id": "g73w3qg", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_j20aiu", "locked": false, "no_follow": false, "parent_id": "t1_g73hz7e", "permalink": "/r/AskWomen/comments/j20aiu/whats_a_good_website_for_a_gal_to_teach_herself/g73w3qg/", "retrieved_on": 1601422836, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "AskWomen", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rxrw", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1601414663.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "BlueKing7642", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_13h2el", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "This free online course teaches techniques to best learn new subjects.\n\nCreated in part by Barbara Oakley who also wrote a book on learning called  **A Mind For Numbers** (highly recommend)\n\n\nhttps://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1601330946, "gildings": {}, "id": "g7010ly", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_j1gejl", "locked": false, "no_follow": false, "parent_id": "t3_j1gejl", "permalink": "/r/IWantToLearn/comments/j1gejl/i_f22_want_to_learn_how_to_freshen_up_my_math/g7010ly/", "retrieved_on": 1601336657, "score": 6, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1601330946.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "thearchitectprincess", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_25c6x537", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Hey there.\n\nI don't want to annoy you, but I do want you to consider for a moment that you are 15.

You don't want to go to school, because what you're learning in school doesn't, on the surface, seem to help you with your passion and interest with going into computers or IT.

There is a possibility that what you're presently learning will not have anything to do with what you want to do. But the disadvantage of regulated education systems is that you will have to go to elementary school and middle school and high school before you can go to college. Theoretically, the longer you stay in education, the more specialised you will get. There are other paths, but it will be more difficult. The easiest way is to stick it out. Eventually, you can get to where you want to be, learning about the things you want to learn that will help you do what you want to do.\n\n&gt;I originally would have gone in an IT direction, but my school doesn't have anything IT related.\n\nYou have the advantage of being a student.

Mas as pausas s\u00e3o importantes.\n\n\n4) Antes de estudar o assunto, use o site de quest\u00f5es que assinou para filtrar as quest\u00f5es daquele concurso. D\u00ea uma olhada no que cai e tente resolver algumas. Depois, folheie o livro/apostila e veja o t\u00edtulo das se\u00e7\u00f5es que voc\u00ea vai estudar, legenda das figuras, legenda das tabelas etc. Depois disso, a\u00ed sim voc\u00ea estuda. Quando terminar de estudar o assunto, volte pro site de quest\u00f5es e fa\u00e7a mais quest\u00f5es de concurso: refa\u00e7a as que tinha feito no in\u00edcio e fa\u00e7a mais.\n\n\n5) De tempos em tempos \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio revisar as quest\u00f5es. Quando for dormir, j\u00e1 deitado na cama, PENSE no que estudou e tente te contar (em pensamento mesmo) o que voc\u00ea aprendeu. Isso vai fazer com que voc\u00ea revise a mat\u00e9ria e vai ajudar o modo difuso do seu c\u00e9rebro durante o sono. Al\u00e9m disso, lembre que eu disse no item 2 para separar umas 3 ou 4 mat\u00e9rias para estudar por dia, certo? Mas nesses dias, revise as outras que n\u00e3o est\u00e1 estudando (eu sei, isso tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 estudo). A revis\u00e3o pode ser feita atrav\u00e9s de exerc\u00edcios: use o site que voc\u00ea assinou.\n\n\n6) Considerando os pesos que a prova d\u00e1 pra cada mat\u00e9ria, foque naquela que voc\u00ea mais tem defici\u00eancia. A gente tem a tend\u00eancia a estudar o que \u00e9 mais legal, mas temos muito mais possibilidade de ganhar pontos na mat\u00e9ria que a gente \u00e9 pior! \u00c9 muito mais f\u00e1cil voc\u00ea aumentar seu rendimento de 30% pra 50% do que de 80% pra 90%.\n\n\nFazendo isso direitinho eu garanto que vai aumentar seu percentual de acerto rapidamente.\n\n\nSugiro fortemente pra todo mundo o curso \"learn how to learn\" no coursera.

Take a look at the code. Look at open issues and pull requests. Read through pieces of the code. Try using the software. See if there are ways you might be able to contribute to the project - even if it's writing documentation instead of code. **AIM LOW**. If you're new to it, try contributing patches to fix typos before you try to offer to refactor the codebase or design a new API for it.\n\nTake online classes. There are a lot of free, high quality classes available at sites like [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [edX](https://www.edx.org/), [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) and other places. If you can afford it, consider going to a code school - there are many schools which courses that will bring you up to speed in about six months.\n\nSomeone else mentioned learning [git](https://git-scm.com/). Git (and other version control systems but seriously - git) is a fundamental tool for managing the software development process today. I can't overstate its importance.\n\nRead tutorials on testing methodology. This is a big one that people often overlook. Testing is very important to writing good software, and writing testable code will help inform how the project is structured and what conventions the code follows.\n\nFind a mentor. There are  experienced programmers out there who are happy to put some effort into helping other people learn. If there's a hackerspace or maker space local to you that can be a good place to meet people. Or look for meetups near you in specific domains you're interested in. If you find someone who makes you feel bad about what you don't know, ditch them, they're not worth your time.\n\nLearn a few things shallowly. Learn one thing deeply (or: pick one thing to focus on). Learn how to write some simple, superficial programs in a few different languages - maybe Python, Javascript, C (if you want to learn embedded programming, definitely learn some C - if you don't, it's probably not a priority unless you want to hack Linux). Think about the similarities and differences you see just writing those simple programs. Pick one medium-sized project (maybe something that would take you about a month) that you're interested in and dive into it.\n\nDon't be afraid to get your hands dirty. If you want to work in embedded systems, try putting together some hardware. Even if it's just lighting up LEDs with an Arduino or running a web controlled application on an ESP32. Having some understanding of how the hardware works will inform your understanding of how the software works and what its limitations and boundaries are.\n\nCode with other people. This is a natural if you contribute to an open source project, but even if you don't, you'll need these skills for working on code in a big codebase because you will  be part of a team.\n\nLearn a commonly used editor or IDE. For instance, [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) are commonly used. If you're working in an Apple environment you're definitely using [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/). [Atom](https://atom.io/) is quite flexible.  If you want to go old school there's [vim](https://www.vim.org/) and [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/) but... probably don't do that unless you have a really good reason.\n\nLearn to ask questions. [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is an incredible resource. Many people asking questions on it are terrible at it. It's a tool; learn how to use it well and don't be afraid of hitting your thumb with the hammer when you use it.\n\nCut yourself slack. People have a lot of conflicting opinions about how to write good code. They're not all right. People often communicate about coding in ways that assume you already have the same mental model of what to do as they do. If you get frustrated, it's natural and the fault is not necessarily yours. And honestly a lot of software development systems out there are horrible, poorly thought out and user hostile.\n\nRemember that \"good\" is meaningful in context. Sometimes big projects will cut corners in order to actually ship code. Good often equals good enough. Some programmers think \"good\" means fewest lines or most cleverly written code. Some think good code can only be written in one particular language or on one particular platform. This can be fun but you might want to avoid this thinking if you want to work on long lived big projects - their priority will usually be maintainability. Each of the companies you mentioned is likely to have somewhat different, frustrating takes on what makes code good.\n\nThis won't happen overnight. In fact, you'll be decades into your programming career and you'll still be learning new things because the industry itself will continue to evolve and the tools will continue to change. Methodologies and processes will change over time. As you gain experience try to stay fluid and open to learning what the kids are doing these days.\n\nGood luck!", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1600651839, "edited": 1600665725.0, "gildings": {}, "id": "g61zlwz", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_iwj3os", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_iwj3os", "permalink": "/r/embedded/comments/iwj3os/how_to_learn_how_to_write_good_code_for_big/g61zlwz/", "retrieved_on": 1600732474, "score": 3, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "embedded", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qins", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 1, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1600651839.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "AWS_2019", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4a5eq597", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Congratulations on being a student, as a student, you are eligible for a better offer from Google.\n\nSignup [here](https://edu.google.com/programs/students/benefits/?modal_active=none) to get:\n\n* the [Qwiklabs catalog](https://www.qwiklabs.com/) for free.\n* The list of online courses below from CoursEra free, no credit card required, not a trial offer.\n* $50 in Google Cloud Credits for you to practice live.\n* Also read through all the student benefits available to  you [here](https://edu.google.com/programs/students/?modal_active=none#cloud-training-tutorials).\n* Learn more about [Student Google Developer Clubs](https://developers.google.com/community/dsc/?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTnpFMVpXVmxNVFF4TVRkaCIsInQiOiJaS3VmbUs5cHZNQWplRUF6dkdVcytxbTBZSVJ0dnByMjg1cGlyblRcLzNyM25nNlQ1cDNPSjBcL29XdytOT3BLN0p4SmVNMjU5dHc4OWdoUndGVnRkTVBhNk1JaXBqQjRMYkwwbURqUW5DZzU3U09VMmkxZklnNk5LUHIrejZrWTFnIn0%3D) and apply to become a [Google Student Club lead](https://www.reddit.com/r/googlecloud/comments/h0guiq/students_become_a_developer_student_club_lead/) \\- applications available again in April 2021\n\n## Online Courses (Free from Google on CoursEra)\n\nGet free access to 13 Google fundamentals courses on Coursera, signup [here](https://edu.google.com/programs/students/benefits/?modal_active=none).\n\nAvailable courses:\n\n1.

There are people for whom it was a matter of figuring ot how to learn, e.g. Barbara Oakley who tells a bit of her own story in the free online course [https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) which is a solid resource on learning in general (not particularly for languages). \n\nOne thing is to put up with a lot of memorization. There are tools like Anki to help with that. There is no way around some serious leg work. When it comes to variations and exceptions, it's about taking it slowly one thing at a time, then the next, then a mix of the two, and so on, the repeat the previous stuff. Nobody remembers it all at once. In language didactics people talk about a spiral movement through all the topics. You do not go through things from A to Z and are done, but you go in circles, internalizing firs the general idea, revisiting after some time understanding a bit more, doing something else again, and revisiting the previous concept another time, each time taking away more of it so it become familiar.

You gotta really like what you're learning. If you do, staying motivated most days will be fairly easy (there will always be some sluggish days of course). If you don't enjoy most of your major-related classes, it'll feel like work. Boring work. And what's the point of that?\n\n Follow your passions and learning can be one of the most enjoyable things to do. I wouldn't recommend going to uni just for the sake of a future career / money.\n\nIn terms of study habits, the thing you'll hear people say is the most important is time-management skills. Try to create a daily to-do list (with the time period for each activity), and have all your tests and assignment deadlines written in a calendar (could be on your phone).\n\nMy personal best piece of advice (for trying to get high grades) is to truly believe that you can get a 100% or close to for each of your courses. Then aim for it. And finally work for it. Even if you fall a little short, you might still end up with a low 90. And once the semester is done and your hard work pays off, its so so satisfying.\n\nAlso, make sure to experiment since everyone has their own strategies that work best.\n\nIf you want extra study advice, Courses offers a great, free course called 'learning to learn'.\n\nhttps://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiEq-Xl6eLrAhUDU98KHVDzBLIQFjAGegQIBBAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw3K8O2citw8ae-P786wrPbU", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1599886668, "gildings": {}, "id": "g4wicn9", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ir5g1v", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_ir5g1v", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/ir5g1v/serious_generally_speaking_how_can_a_30_year_old/g4wicn9/", "retrieved_on": 1599890871, "score": 5, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1599886668.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "enchwurm", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "eeec8d98-1c2d-11e5-a80c-0e610b6925bb", "author_flair_text": "ENTJ\u2640", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3yhi65jx", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "I looked these up for OP, but he deleted his account so I will give them to you \ud83d\udc9b\n\n[here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/race-cultural-diversity-american-life)\n\n[And here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00849/full) - this is long but relevant. You could also check out the references for more material.\n\nFrom the article above:\n\n&gt;Given these findings, how is it that people often persist in believing that people from different countries hold different values? Some factors are likely to be motivational: abundant evidence points to the roles of realistic group conflict (Bobo, 1983), social identification (Tajfel and Turner, 1986), symbolic racism (Kinder and Sears, 1981), and various biases (e.g., symbolic self-completion,\u00a0Gollwitzer et al., 1982, or system justification,\u00a0Jost and Banaji, 1994) that can lead us to feel that our own group is superior to other groups in numerous characteristics, including values. Other factors are cognitive: social learning (Bandura et al., 1961) and stereotyping processes (e.g., illusory correlation,\u00a0Hamilton and Rose, 1980) may lead us to encode other groups\u2019 characteristics in ways that magnify the differences between groups. More relevant to the present research, however, is the nature of the values concept itself. Specifically, as abstract ideals, values subsume a wide range of behaviors as exemplars of the concepts. People may perceive differences between social groups because of the differences between groups in the specific behaviors that are seen as exemplars of different values, even if other behaviors that are exemplars of the values do not differ. Thus, by thinking about groups in terms of concrete instances, differences may be stronger than similarities.\n\n&gt;In other words, people in different social groups may endorse the same values but associate different behaviors with them (Maio, 2010).\u00a0", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1599885135, "edited": 1599885567.0, "gildings": {}, "id": "g4wgbnj", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ippt9u", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_g4r1i9c", "permalink": "/r/entj/comments/ippt9u/thoughts_on_equity/g4wgbnj/", "retrieved_on": 1599889889, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "entj", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r36o", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1599885135.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "MC_Raw", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_41vz8w3s", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "I would suggest checking out this course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn\n\nReading your post, it sounds like you could really benefit from a better understanding of how one learns.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1599808216, "gildings": {}, "id": "g4swm1x", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_iql162", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_iql162", "permalink": "/r/learnprogramming/comments/iql162/i_dont_think_im_learning/g4swm1x/", "retrieved_on": 1599821782, "score": 2, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "learnprogramming", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r7yd", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1599808216.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "ASIC_SP", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_kq1d5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "**Programming fundamentals**\n\n* [Think Python](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) \u2014 gives you a solid foundation to programming, teaches debugging right the beginning, includes case studies, exercises, etc\n    * [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Interactive Edition](https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html) \u2014 inspired by Think Python\n* [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) \u2014 teaches you programming concepts and then shows how to automate everyday problems\n* [Python Crash Course](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_2e/regular_index/) \u2014 teaches you programming concepts and then goes through projects on games, data visualization and web applications\n\n**If you need courses with certificates**\n\n* [Harvard CS50: Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science) \u2014 self paced free course on edx.

I am not talking about certs. What does your home lab look like? What does your cloud lab look like? Do you have a GitHub? What do you have to *differentiate yourself* against candidates at employers that are *not your current employer*? \n\nExamples-\n\n* Want to go down DevOps Engineer path? https://roadmap.sh/devops\n\n* Want to get into Network Engineering? What does your GNS3 environment look like at home? \n\n* Want to get into Project Management? Tell me what your PDUs look like and how closely aligned you are to passing the PMP certification.\n\n* Want to get into cloud computing from a Solutions Architect perspective? Tell me what your AWS or Azure or GCP Free Tier environment looks like.\n\n* More on DevOps -- So you've made a few DevOps-y resource endpoints like S3, EC2 and RDS. Cool. Now tell me how that infrastructure has been stored as code on your GitHub.\n\nThese are all things that are *free* to you now, and/or open-source. GitHub is free, AWS Free Tier is free, GNS3 is free-- acquiring PDUs is free. \n\nI brought up inland vs coastal territories because the difference in candidate is huge. In Boston, I was talking to a college student who I'm *guessing* is age 20 (you can't legally ask their age, but you can put two-and-two together looking at their expected graduation date on LinkedIn) who had already spun up resources on AWS and was building an application in NodeJS to work in server and serverless formats. I am actively talking to a 16 year old right now based in California (they openly disclosed their age, I did not ask) who has already began exploring Kubernetes, Istio, and they're now trying to get their hands on Google Anthos for some website project they're working on. \n\nInland territories, on the other hand, I don't typically see candidates like the ones I just described.\n\nI too have worked an unfair workplace. My first IT employer was 99% white. It was the state of Arizona. I am a person of color, Asian male. I literally was the only Asian in the entire IT department for almost 4 years. I was passed up for good promotions, and the only promotions I qualified for were useless ones, like going from tier 1 to tier 2 helpdesk (THAT IS NOT A PROMOTION, PEOPLE-- WAKE UP). Plus the environment was too slow for me anyway, I wanted to move faster with my career. So I took matters into my own hands. Websites like [**learn.cantrill.io**](https://learn.cantrill.io), [**LinuxAcademy**](https://www.linuxacademy.com), [**Coursera**](https://www.coursera.org) will enable you for success but make sure you're not just learning for the sake of learning. **Do things with the knowledge you learn**  which is why all my bullet points above were centered around *actionable activity* and not just theoretical knowledge or a piece of paper certification. \n\nA lot of newbies to IT make the mistake of working a helpdesk role and assume that they can just work their way up. There is a reason you are not getting promoted. So use that to your advantage, don't wallow in it. Are you a crowd-follower who mindlessly takes orders? No? Then that's probably why you were not promoted. My manager at that first employer later revealed to me (after I left, of course) that I was not promoted to those other positions because they *instinctively knew* that I was a flight risk, *even though I myself did not realize it back then about myself*!\n\n&gt; Nothing on my resume speaks SME at a concentrated system\n\nThis is why I advocate home lab / cloud lab approach. So your workplace won't give you experience in a concentrated system? Go make your own. For free, mind you. Look at the roadmap in my first bullet point.

They're all GLMs and they're all fundamentally correlations.  \nThat book has more advanced stuff after, but you don't necessarily need to learn it.\n\nAll that and you'll set for undergrad. If you do grad school, you'll learn that (just like any other time you learn math-related stuff), nobody uses that stuff you learned. Fret not, though: learning GLMs is still the foundation! The next step is to learn multilevel-modelling, which is a more advanced form of GLM that takes account of \"nested\" data. The classic example is students nested in classes nested in schools nested in school-districts: the fact that a bunch of data-points (students) all share a common classroom is ignored in basic GLMs but multilevel-modelling accounts for that. It's easy once you know how to do GLMs and it's just a different line of R code.\n\nAlso... learn R. You might start out uncomfortable with coding, but that's life: you gotta push through ignorance to learn. There are plenty of free introductory courses to learn R and this is one skill that will translate even if you pursue other things.\n\nEDIT: If you bounce off the first book, check out [Andy Field's \"Discovering Statistics\"](https://www.discoveringstatistics.com/about/).

It's definitely not good if you hate it!\n\nLike one of the tricks for me with studying was to only study in ways that actually helped me pass. Doing lots of practice tests and problems exhausts me, so I never did a full timed test.\n\nI tutored students before I got my first engineering job, and one of the things I've always had to do is help people get over the 'emotional' component where they're miserable or negative. 100% those emotions are impacting your ability to retain information and also to study in a way that will help you feel confident and comfortable on exam day! \n\nIn the end, if civil is truly unsatisfying for you on a deep level, I wish you all the best in transitioning to a career that better meets your needs!
