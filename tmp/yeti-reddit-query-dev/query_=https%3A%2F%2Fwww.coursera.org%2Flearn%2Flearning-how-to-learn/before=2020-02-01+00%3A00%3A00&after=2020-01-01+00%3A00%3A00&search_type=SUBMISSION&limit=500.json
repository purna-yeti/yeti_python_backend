Processes relate to simple habits\u2014habits that coincidentally allow you to do the unpleasant tasks that need to be done.\n* Procrastination can be triggered by feelings of discomfort involving something you'd rather not be doing--discomfort that can actually show up in the brain as feelings of physical pain.\n* Procrastination shares characteristics with addiction. \n* It's best to avoid procrastination by applying willpower at only one small point--your reaction to a procrastination cue. This is because willpower is actually a valuable mental resource and you don't want to be using it up unnecessarily. \n* The Pomodoro technique is effective because it helps you get into the flow of the process.\n* Planning your quitting time is as important as planning your working time.\n* Making your task list is best done at night before you go to sleep because research has shown that it helps to enlist your zombies (subconscious processes) to process the list, making them easier to get through the items on that list the next day.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "productivity", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1k", "subreddit_subscribers": 385552, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "You should try Learn How To Learn course by Barbara Oakley", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/epinpr/you_should_try_learn_how_to_learn_course_by/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1579177581.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "mmcc007", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_zguu2of", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578285301, "domain": "self.Anki", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/ekovfg/learning_how_to_learn_anki_deck/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ekovfg", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 19, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Anki/comments/ekovfg/learning_how_to_learn_anki_deck/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1578285302, "score": 1, "selftext": "Recently created a deck based on the Coursera course 'Learning How to Learn' (millions of students). The deck is intended as a starter deck for students (including myself) of the course and to demonstrate the power of spaced recall to mostly first time Anki users (and for my own use). Students can then modify the deck to suit their own learning preferences. Seeing as this is a first-time Anki deck for me, it could use some feedback.\n\nAs a first pass, I copied text and related screenshots and audio snippets and made a bunch of cards (mostly cloze and some basic) with a link back to the video of the related lecture. There are about 40 short lectures, resulting in about 200 cards, almost all with an audio snippet, text for the audio, and a matching screenshot.\n\nFound that this was not a great approach as the cards were not sticking well in memory. The questions are too long (only read the 20 rules a few days ago). So I am reworking the deck to simplify the questions. The current approach is to try to keep the text, audio and screenshot, as much as possible, and split-out each card into simple cards.\n\nOn the first pass I also ended-up creating a subdeck for each lecture, so will merge into one deck and use tags instead.\n\nThe deck is here: [https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1266436294](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1266436294)\n\nThe course is here: [https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)\n\n(got permission from course author, Barbara Oakley, to use text, audio and screenshots)\n\nAnyone got any suggestions on how to prepare cards from a lecture series like this?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Anki", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s9lm", "subreddit_subscribers": 20743, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Learning How to Learn Anki deck", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/ekovfg/learning_how_to_learn_anki_deck/", "created": 1578285301.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "LongLiveBacon", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ckpqo", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578193723, "domain": "self.Superlearning", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Superlearning/comments/ek741g/info_resources_on_superlearning_and_recommended/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ek741g", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Superlearning/comments/ek741g/info_resources_on_superlearning_and_recommended/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "-B2RYnvKjSBs2Ixt2k7Wo34JLLs72aNpuisbBK3i_vw", "resolutions": [{"height": 56, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/p9joXGatHld84Wl_zr4I_UomOa5M90G3GgOQbQMxnak.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76cf741edf36ba1daabda43903aff6701ee9ff2f", "width": 108}, {"height": 113, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/p9joXGatHld84Wl_zr4I_UomOa5M90G3GgOQbQMxnak.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91dff6c55c62f6c90848c99ef27aee718a22e157", "width": 216}, {"height": 168, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/p9joXGatHld84Wl_zr4I_UomOa5M90G3GgOQbQMxnak.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46bf9a61b5a59245316b60bd8306184799125e30", "width": 320}, {"height": 336, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/p9joXGatHld84Wl_zr4I_UomOa5M90G3GgOQbQMxnak.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be1d70685ca6cf448bef335bbb15f34111fa8ce0", "width": 640}, {"height": 504, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/p9joXGatHld84Wl_zr4I_UomOa5M90G3GgOQbQMxnak.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd29a251fde1a6782cc5863416ab87221717044b", "width": 960}, {"height": 567, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/p9joXGatHld84Wl_zr4I_UomOa5M90G3GgOQbQMxnak.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9317991d10164b3ea43b69e6e9e60bd1c425ad1a", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 630, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/p9joXGatHld84Wl_zr4I_UomOa5M90G3GgOQbQMxnak.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=dbf67b5b767e33b3f57c82ee1740f8b12cc6fe6a", "width": 1200}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1578215481, "score": 1, "selftext": "**Recommended Courses:**\n\n* [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) (Coursera, free) - Great basis on the learning process and how to deal with procrastination.\n* [Become a SuperLearner 2](https://www.udemy.com/course/become-a-superlearner-2-speed-reading-memory-accelerated-learning/) (Udemy, variable price) - Focuses on learning quick and speed reading\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Recommended Reading:**\n\n* [A Mind For Numbers (Barbara Oakley)](https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Numbers-Science-Flunked-Algebra/dp/039916524X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=WXCC24Q5RU4F&amp;keywords=a+mind+for+numbers&amp;qid=1578193672&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=A+Mind+For+%2Cstripbooks%2C248&amp;sr=1-1) \\- Written by host of Learning How to Learn.

taught myself how to develop phone apps. [Proof](https://imgur.com/a/Aaj75R7)\n\n**Background**\n\nThree years ago I ran into a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) about a system called No Zero Days. The idea was to do something everyday, no matter the size, towards your goal. No having much direction or knowledge, I decided that I wanted to learn how to code. When I first started I bought a online course and tackled one video lesson a day. Starting off, I learned very slowly. I took several beginner coding courses as I wasn't picking up a lot of the key concepts. Eventually I went towards application development and began coding, 1-2 hours, on simple applications everyday.\n\nA big leap forward in my learning journey came from another reddit post, which talked about Learning How to Learn. Learning How To Learn gave insight on why I procrastinated so much.  After applying several of the methods learned for learning, I was understanding material much quicker. Through applying these learning methods, I learned how to use AWS and deployed my own servers so I could utilize a backend for my apps. Learning How to Learn is a free course on which you can find [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn).\n\n**What have I learned?**\n\nThe most important lesson that I have learned through my journey is that difficult problems and concepts generally take more than one look to solve or understand. A tendency that I used to have was to give up at the first sign of difficultly. Its scary when something doesn't click in your head and you have to face the idea that maybe you never under figure it out.\n\nThere were many times when I was developing an application where I would run into a problem I thought was impossible for me to solve. I would be dealing with the same problem for weeks, not making any progress towards a solution. Although there were many times I doubted my own ability to solve a problem, there wasn't a single time were a didn't eventually find a solution.\n\nAnother lesson is that habits work better than motivation. Motivation is very good at burst of actions but don't really help when times get difficult. Achieving goals and getting good at something requires consistent action and a long term commitment. Habits take between three month to a year to form depending on what you are to do. I believe that building good habits is the best investment you can make.\n\nAlso when starting something new, it's best to take slow small steps. It's more important to form long term habits than to go hard and eventually give up.\n\n**Whats the app?**\n\nThe application I am launching today is called Steps - Action Inspires. It's a social media application crossed between a habit tracker. You set Todos, which is an action you plan to do consistently throughout the week. Whenever you complete a Todo, it shows up on your followers feeds. Your media feed is comprised of actions of the people you follow.\n\nTracking your progress is crucial when you attempting something new and challenging . A huge motivating factor for me was seeing the growth and improvement I was making. I believe that by seeing what others are doing towards their goals and the effort it takes to become successful is inspirational and provides additional motivation\n\n**Moving Forward**\n\nAs coding everyday is a strong habit of mine, I will continue to work on coding and improving Steps everyday. There are still many aspects which will be improved on such as design. You can follow me on my app, my username is im\\_so\\_shing. I'll definitely follow you back as I am excited to see the progress and actions people will take.\n\nI've made a simple website to showcase the application at [stepsactioninspires.com](https://stepsactioninspires.com) and if you would like to start your Steps today you can download it on [IOS (apple store page)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/steps-action-inspires/id1491714172?ls=1) and [Android (google play page)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stepsdebugv2)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "IAmA", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qzb6", "subreddit_subscribers": 19667814, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I am a self taught app developer, who learned through coding a little bit everyday for the last three years.

Which is a very valid point. But the user (thou shalt not be named) went on to say \"DoNT StaRT a BuSiNEss\" and basically not to buy a single course or anything.\n\nLO AND BEHOLD, said user literally had a post on his/her  account about how to create your own course... So that's that. \n\nMy point is this, this isn't the only instance of this sort of mentality in this sub or even amongst the entrepreneur community. I'm not saying this sub is filled to the rim with this sort of thing, it's just something I've noticed in more then one post/thread.\n\nA lot of people seem to be sending messages out that basically claim that if you weren't an entrepreneur in the past you'll never be one. \n\nWhich, I'm sorry to break it you, but that **ISNT TRUE**. \n\nListen, people come from so many different types of backgrounds that it is literally impossible to make a generalization like that. \n\nSome people come from backgrounds where they didn't have the time to even consider building a business or anything because life happens and they were probably too focused on surviving the crazy shit that life throws at people. They didn't have the time to devote hours to research and learning new skills or even to find out what the hell they wanted to do in life or what their interests are to begin with. Honestly, anyone who is a successful entrepreneur **consider yourself lucky to be one**. It's a blessing. \n\nIs entrepreneurship for everyone? No. But you don't have to have been an entrepreneur in the past to start being one now. However, there is no \"fast track\" to building a successful business. It often take countless hours and even years to cultivate the idea in your head and to build it out in real life. And even then it might fail! But then you pick yourself up and go back at it. There are so many successful entrepreneurs who have failed more times than they have succeeded but they kept pursuing their goals. At times, it can take relentless pursuit to build something you might have thought was \"simple\" but that's just the name of the game. \n\nIf there's anyone reading this who has felt discouraged in the past because of a message sent to you similar to the one I've outlined, please do not buy into it. Keep pursuing, be consistent, and persevere.\n\n\nIf you don't know where to go to get started with learning the skills you need and dont have the budget for college, here are a few: \n\n* (20 sites where you can get free courses &amp; paid)[https://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/20-places-educate-yourself-online-for-free.html] \n\n* (YouTube)[https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://m.youtube.com/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj3jZaZmuTmAhWGHM0KHVmdA5MQjjgwAHoECAYQAw&amp;usg=AOvVaw1gjD0qA2OtrsxdcaNbwsxk] \n       - I learned all the skills I needed on YouTube to get my first freelancing job....
