There's also Google certified ones on coursera and Amazon. There's ones from universities too as well as online masters delivered through coursera, but I think if you aren't wanting to do a masters then the industry certified courses are better for employability than the shorter university courses as the industry ones are much more applied and you will produce some of your own work as part of it. I find the none masters university coursera courses are more theory based/harder to practice. There's also a ton more free courses on coursera that it could be worth you doing before committing to pay as you might find you want to specialise in say machine learning and then a more specialise certificate course could be the way forward.
