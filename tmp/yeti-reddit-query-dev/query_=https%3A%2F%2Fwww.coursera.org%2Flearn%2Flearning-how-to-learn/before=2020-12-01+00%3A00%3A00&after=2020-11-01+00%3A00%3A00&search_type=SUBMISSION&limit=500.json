I made a post not too long ago asking for a starting point, I got some good papers and advice. However I wasn't able to understand all of papers and my ML knowledge was still limited(still is). I've been a bit short of time recently so I haven't done as much as I've wanted to. But I've been trying to increase my knowledge of both portfolio management and ML. \n\nCurrently I'm doing the Sentdex practical ML tuts and a coursera course on portfolio construction with ML. The [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/investment-management-python-machine-learning) course is broken into 4 parts each with 4 'weeks'. However apparently the last 2 parts are the ML parts and they're shit(reviews) so I won't even look at them. I want to move onto my own implementations now or at least experimenting so do I need to learn anything outside of the Markowitz model to achieve what I want? Since it appears they're done with covering those areas on the course(I'm on part 1 week 3. But it's essentially at least everything in the portfolio optimization link in this subs sidebar). Also the same goes for the sentdex videos, for example SVM's. I will cover these a bit in my module for big data and ML, so it appears I could skip these but I don't want my knowledge to be lacking.\n\nBut I feel like I'm starting to lose my mental picture of what I thought an ML implementation could look like, since I'm only really doing learning and not implementation. I was just wondering if you could give me any ideas for a basic portfolio ML model, what would be the simplest method or framework to apply this to. How appropriate is a NN implementation?\n\nJust a few other questions: Would a markowitz model using quadratic optimizer be a good ground truth? How can I show an ml implementation outperforms a traditional optimization method? Are there other useful metrics outside of say sharpe ratio, returns, drawdown ect?\n\nSorry if this is all waffle or incoherant I just feel a bit lost with my direction since I've been just learning these two separate topics, as well as other topics for uni in general.

All it takes is a few nights of struggling to quiet your active brain, and suddenly it's a habit. At first you are tired, ready to sleep, 10 minutes in and you feel widely awake and baffled with where all the tiredness went. I know this because I suffered from it for 2 months. I solved it by getting up whenever I felt awake, do something else like reading a book until I feel tired again, then go back to bed.\n\nWhat I'm saying is, there are things that *we condition ourselves into* and until we deliberately break the pattern systematically for a few days or weeks we will never be cured. And maybe this is why now that I'm trying to work from home I struggle with concentrating and be productive, because I'm used to mindlessly scroll through Reddit or hunt demons in video games. And to break this habit I won't need to uninstall games or Reddit but deliberately study when I can and if I have the urge to act out something I shouldn't (like staying awake in bed or play video games on PC) get up and do something else until the mood to play goes away, or rather the mood to study comes back.\n\nJust throwing random thoughts on the floor.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "nosurf", "subreddit_id": "t5_2st2y", "subreddit_subscribers": 134053, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "People condition themselves to perform differently on different environments", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/jvc88k/people_condition_themselves_to_perform/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1605551831.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "twinklefuck", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_87p3j2zm", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1605003559, "domain": "self.cscareerquestions", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jrild2/cs_engineering_graduate_ug_here_need_your_help_in/", "gildings": {}, "id": "jrild2", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Student"}], "link_flair_template_id": "c9dd4bf2-b859-11e3-8535-12313d31e5b1", "link_flair_text": "Student", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jrild2/cs_engineering_graduate_ug_here_need_your_help_in/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "Fdl3imsGJ4vaHKDmG0Md_TAhFEr2_FASZqajWblEgRA", "resolutions": [{"height": 56, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/w07gE3zsEK43e78Vf3Y5qaZGBXytL4z_Jh8b9mFcezw.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f4e0bdd34121da46f69496c726ba295330508f7", "width": 108}, {"height": 113, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/w07gE3zsEK43e78Vf3Y5qaZGBXytL4z_Jh8b9mFcezw.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84b35df5519e8bc98fc4eb5787500faee8db7610", "width": 216}, {"height": 167, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/w07gE3zsEK43e78Vf3Y5qaZGBXytL4z_Jh8b9mFcezw.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb53a74c86fc91164138fa0c616b1137dbd7dcc2", "width": 320}, {"height": 335, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/w07gE3zsEK43e78Vf3Y5qaZGBXytL4z_Jh8b9mFcezw.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b5dbfbc33be5e77ccaf5f9f99a52f8c4dbc81cd", "width": 640}, {"height": 502, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/w07gE3zsEK43e78Vf3Y5qaZGBXytL4z_Jh8b9mFcezw.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b1c03d0e7abf6f1f93a651de410c0c46b4ecbeb", "width": 960}, {"height": 565, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/w07gE3zsEK43e78Vf3Y5qaZGBXytL4z_Jh8b9mFcezw.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42199aa240fb8cf830685b9dc722497638c6ad24", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 928, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/w07gE3zsEK43e78Vf3Y5qaZGBXytL4z_Jh8b9mFcezw.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=91367505fcbb406f17cef9e5ed89b9bf9eeeae94", "width": 1772}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1605003569, "score": 1, "selftext": "In May 2021, I will be having my degree certificate in Computer Science and Engineering (Bachelor's) and I am still not certain about what's next.\n\nFor you to be able to help, here's a little background of me:\n\n* Currently a **final year student**\n* Had an **year-gap** during the undergraduate degree (failed it with pride, in other words)\n* Loves to write code (but, I still consider **myself a noob** even when I have done 3 projects, never gained the confidence)\n* Loves to write film-screenplays and has interests along the fields of **film-making**\n* **Low CGPA** (6.97/10) - but this will be improving in my last two semesters\n\nHere's what I'm doing right now:\n\nI'm familiar with Python, and it has bored me out with all the data science projects I've been doing. So, instead of Python, I'm learning about Object Oriented Programming in Java, because Java seemed to catch my eye and it's been amazing so far. Here's the link to the specialization course: [Coursera #1](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-object-oriented?ranMID=40328&amp;ranEAID=12nx9BdDApY&amp;ranSiteID=12nx9BdDApY-nfkD6bqQ_lVtByyAgtQd0A&amp;siteID=12nx9BdDApY-nfkD6bqQ_lVtByyAgtQd0A&amp;utm_content=10&amp;utm_medium=partners&amp;utm_source=linkshare&amp;utm_campaign=12nx9BdDApY)\n\nAnd, once I'm done with this specialization (hoping to finish it in the next two months) I'll be moving on to learn about Android Application Development ([Coursera #2](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/android-app-development)) because I feel like creating some apps the way I want to, in a way I think I'll be loving the process.\n\nSo, these two courses are on my checklist. I'll be doing them no matter what. And, I also will be doing a Design Project this semester (mainly Web Development using Scrapy) \n\nSo, apart from these - in the 6-7 months to come (and after) what should I be doing to land a software development job? I am aware of the skill-development suggestions. So, what I'm really looking for is - how did someone make it in the world of software with same situation like mine? How did you define your career roadmap? How tough/challenging is it to get the first job? Should I instead do my Masters and then look for a job with better academic scores?\n\nAny help is much appreciated. Thanks.\n\n*Note: I'll be doing internship in my last semester. It'll mostly be unpaid and I don't really care as long as I get some experience working on something real.*", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "cscareerquestions", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpm", "subreddit_subscribers": 446912, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "CS Engineering Graduate (UG) here, need your help in forming my roadmap (please read completely)", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/jrild2/cs_engineering_graduate_ug_here_need_your_help_in/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1605003559.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "RynoCerus", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3zq8v", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1605000036, "domain": "self.ccna", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ccna/comments/jrhxpq/first_attempt_pass_with_2_main_resources_8651000/", "gildings": {}, "id": "jrhxpq", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 13, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/ccna/comments/jrhxpq/first_attempt_pass_with_2_main_resources_8651000/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "9BSf5Bl2u25LMAxa2JYtzss97VnSQSOMXWAVCYKw9wQ", "resolutions": [{"height": 56, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/yzSPg0RMMgPAakMZ5sDtKPzHIdByEmcMVilDRUHUxIY.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44ff211105a9ff5f26a753f2faee4ff93d2a9fee", "width": 108}, {"height": 113, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/yzSPg0RMMgPAakMZ5sDtKPzHIdByEmcMVilDRUHUxIY.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aef8a96154edaf6cfdfe6883f654bc62b9c8ff42", "width": 216}, {"height": 167, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/yzSPg0RMMgPAakMZ5sDtKPzHIdByEmcMVilDRUHUxIY.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01ca83db9f0255f1647452c580abbca7541ec66e", "width": 320}, {"height": 335, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/yzSPg0RMMgPAakMZ5sDtKPzHIdByEmcMVilDRUHUxIY.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=407e745cc419131838258db8502a9787d9eb9a8d", "width": 640}, {"height": 502, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/yzSPg0RMMgPAakMZ5sDtKPzHIdByEmcMVilDRUHUxIY.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67cb1200ecf2b24b76828af0a11cbe57d2b59df9", "width": 960}, {"height": 565, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/yzSPg0RMMgPAakMZ5sDtKPzHIdByEmcMVilDRUHUxIY.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=309fefe0577ad2c5405fa547739fd6239601666a", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 928, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/yzSPg0RMMgPAakMZ5sDtKPzHIdByEmcMVilDRUHUxIY.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=11f8dbaed9a441b7b00fe9b7ac518c4e997e94e2", "width": 1772}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1605000047, "score": 1, "selftext": "**Background/Experience**\n\n- 2 years at an MSP as an entry level Service Technician (not really much CCNA related day-to-day work though).\n- Took [this free online course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) about learning how to learn. This might seem a bit dry to most but I found it interesting and helped me understand good practices for learning/studying. Plus it's free!\n\n**Resources**\n\n- CBT Nuggets (about 4 months): Ran through this long course taking **thorough** notes for most of my study. Most people love Keith and I did find him quite good, but I really enjoyed Jeremy's modules the most. The virtual labs in this course are very useful for getting a feel of the CLI. Won't cover 100% of things you'll need to know but a great foundation.\n- Boson ExSim (about 1 month): Took each of the exams and then revised all my answers making sure I **understood** each answer. This was very helpful for filling in my gaps from CBT Nuggets. It's a good indicator of what the test will feel like, possibly slightly harder as most people attest to. I failed all three practice exams on my first attempts, however after studying up and making sure I understood the answers I felt much better heading into the exam. They have great explanations for ever answer, and why certain answers are incorrect.\n\n**Other Notes**\n\n- Know your Routing and Subnetting.
