There's something about picturing an urge like a wave, that will peak and pass, that helps me ride it out. \n\nAlso CalmHarm and CBT Toolbox have been helpful apps.\n\nAnother thing that helps me is to HALT (ask yourself if you are hungry, angry, lonely or tired, and if you are, address the immediate need). I also add an \"O\" for overwhelmed because I know I'm prone to self harm if I really need to take a break/step back from a situation, do some self care, or say no to someone. Writing is also good because sometimes I use self harm to express and communicate. When I journal or write crappy poetry or a letter I won't send or do some art, it keeps my hands busy while I'm feeling it, and then afterward I often find I don't need to hurt myself anymore. Doesn't matter if the art was good or not because \"good\" wasn't the point, and so I affectionately refer to this as Shitty Art Tuesday,  where things don't need to be perfect or good, just expressive. Making/holding a cup of tea also keeps my hands busy.\n\n[Box breathing and 54321 grounding](https://www.evergreenyfs.org/Youth%20Anxiety%20Handouts.pdf) are worth a try. I always scoffed when someone suggested \"just breathe,\" but then I actually tried it lol. With grounding, sometimes if I'm having a panic attack or if I'm dissociating, someone will do this with me and prompt me to focus, but I can also do it on my own.\n\nOpen a window, let some light in. \n\nEveryone is different and it can take 5-10 good coping skills to replace 1 bad one. It helps to look at what's going on surrounding your urge, and then address the need. I often self harm when I'm anxious or if I have unresolved trauma resurfacing, so things that work for me may not for someone who uses it for other reasons. Remember nothing is going to work in the same was as self harm, but the more space you can create between urge and action, the more you give your healthy self a chance to grow. We all have a healthy and unhealthy self, and the one that grows is the one you feed. \n\nSome things I like to do for fun...\n\n[Wreck this Journal](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0141976144/ref=cm_sw_r_apa_i_RCqGEbC2YXMQQ)\n\n[Zeal](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJmfG-HbRZ8krA5wVfUelIk17a5JDfK9t) - this guy was struggling with apathy when he wrote this\n\n[Kitchen Sink](https://youtu.be/ZWt2PT8VLsY)\n\nFind something outside of school to learn about.

Pick something (ie trees, windows, shoes, birds), and draw, sketch, paint, collage, sculpt that thing in different moods and lights. Use paint, markers, playdoh, dry noodles or straws or broken CDs. Happy trees, stumps, fall, spring, soggy, grateful, burnt, angry, scrawny, strong, bright, starry. \n\nIf you have a yard, go put your bare feet in the grass and look up.\n\nPlay dress up. Find the wierdest and most ridiculous or fabulous ensamble of clothes in your closet. \n\nWatch Ryan Hamilton or Bo Burnham on Netflix. I'm also partial to Anne with an E. \n\nReread a favorite book (two of my faves are A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith and The Tale of Despereaux by Kate DiCamillo). \n\nWrite a letter to your future self or record a vlog. Talk about what things are like now, be honest, things you enjoy, describe your room and your street, what you're struggling with, what you hope for, advice and things to remember etc. You could put it in a keepsake box or time capsule to open when you're older. \n\nGet a potted cactus or succulent. Grow something. \n\nMake a self care kit. Tons of ideas on pinterest. \n\nMake a special plan for when the coronavirus has settled down, something to look forward to- maybe a trip or get together with friends. \n\nListen to books on hoopla\n\nMake lists of your favorite or least favorite things, stuff you need to do, pointless lists\n\nMake playlists \n\nI like doing yoga for seniors on YouTube or amazon because it's slow and not demanding.\n\nNarrate your pet's day in their voice. \n\nOkay this is ridiculously long.

Their duties are probably the most relevant of your options to the current issues related to the outbreak.\n\nhttps://www.redcross.org/local/washington/volunteer.html \n\nFire Cadets - Some departments may allow youth members, look up the ones near you. Fairly relevant to current crisis.\n\nPolice Explorer programs - may help with outbreak-associated chaos, among other things:\n\nSheriff https://www.facebook.com/pg/ThurstonCountyExplorers/photos/?ref=page_internal\n\nOPD http://olympiawa.gov/city-services/police-department/volunteer-programs.aspx\n\nLacey https://www.facebook.com/LaceyPoliceExplorers/\n\nCivil Air Patrol - not sure what they'd do during this, but perhaps worth asking them:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SouthSoundCompositeSquadron\n\nJROTC units might be somehow working on this, but the schools are closed and I know little about them or how you'd get involved at this point.\n\nOnce this passes, http://tcwesar.com/index.html is a thing if you are interested in helping with disasters and finding lost people, but they aren't really working on the outbreak currently and there's a lot of training involved.\n\nTCDART https://www.thurstoncountywa.gov/em/Pages/org-dart.aspx is 18+ and worth a look once you're older. In other counties CERT-type programs https://www.ready.gov/cert may be open to minors. Get trained if you can.\n\n****\n\nIf none of those options are suitable, perhaps your best bet is teaming up with your parents, adult relatives, or trusted adults with your parents permission, and supporting them in helping others. Food and supply donations and deliveries to elderly, sick, and vulnerable community members may be helpful.\n\nYour peers could probably use emotional support (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_first_aid) in grappling with this. Perhaps learn more about preparedness and survival skills (prudent these days to be a bit of a prepper, just keep it reasonable and focus on realistic issues and perspectives). By learning some peer support skills and prep skills, you can help your friends, their families, and community members to increase their health and resilience, which is important as more disruption could occur to due to the outbreak, and we're also more vulnerable should a different disaster occur on top of this.\n\nIf you're hunkered down and can't go anywhere, here are some other things you could work on so you can better help folks when you have the opportunity to do so:\n\n* Work out at home without much equipment (www.mtntactical.com / https://www.youtube.com/user/mountainathlete) and learn relaxation (https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene)\n* Study medical skills (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/become-an-emt) (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbXdv5N6doMvvb4R6_E4Kdo5xeXL2CNJL)\n* Make a victory garden (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture)\n* Become an amateur radio technician (http://www.arrl.org/licensing-education-training)\n* Study disaster preparedness topics (https://training.fema.gov/is/crslist.aspx)\n* Continue or expand your schooling (https://www.khanacademy.org/) (https://www.youtube.com/user/crashcourse/playlists)\n\nYou can learn a lot for free, and you can carry skills with you wherever you go, unlike supplies which use resources or can be lost. There will be more disasters, even if you feel sidelined for this one you can prepare for the next.

I know many people who went there for undergrad and then went to a top school for masters/PhD in US/UK.\n\nI'm not really sure why you are worrying about masters and PhD textbooks at this point. The math that you need to know is no different from the basic math that any engineering/science/math undergrad student needs when starting university.\n\nIt sounds like you are lacking practice and confidence in your math. In my opinion it would be a mistake to tackle something too ambitious in the beginning. (For example there are many excellent, free online courses from MIT Open Courseware in calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, probability/statistics, but they might be too hard for you to start. Or not; by all means, check out these courses for yourself.) From my experience, math is something that is cumulative. When you skip ahead without having firm foundations at each step, it is a recipe for disaster. You'll actually make faster progress in the long run by going a step or two back and going slow.\n\nOne suggestion is to start with some high school level books aimed at ambitious students. Take a look at the brilliant set of books by AOPS: [https://artofproblemsolving.com/store](https://artofproblemsolving.com/store). They require far deeper understanding than your usual high school calculus books where the emphasis is on routine problem solving. Take a look at the precalculus and calculus books or even the algebra book. Even if it appears too basic, the time you spend making sure you know the basics well is never wasted, particularly for someone like you who has PhD goals. (They also have solutions manuals which make them good for self study.)  These books are deeper than Khan Academy courses, which are fairly superficial. After these books, then you'll be ready for the MIT undergrad courses.\n\n*Additional suggestions:*\n\nThis Stanford course called Intro to Mathematical Thinking ([https://www.coursera.org/learn/mathematical-thinking](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mathematical-thinking)), which is aimed at entering undergrads to teach how proofs are done and the basic language of maths, is worth a look. This knowledge will save you hours and hours later if you learn the rules of the game early on.\n\nWhen you start your undergrad courses (or the MIT OCW courses), you might consider getting and using Mathematica on your computer. It's a great tool for visualizing functions, doing calculus, and a whole lot more. (You can probably get a student license; home edition is also quite reasonably priced.) It's not intended to replace pen and paper skills, but I found that for myself it helped to build intuition when I was learning various concepts. (Also in actual practice and research, i.e. outside your math class, you usually will be using computer tools to do your work. May as well get used to them early.)\n\nFor philosophy and motivation, see this first lecture from an undergrad math for econ course.

Before you pick a series of courses to pursue, have a read of each course's page, and look at its aims and structure, then pick one program and stick with it, as courses on the same pathway should be designed with its other constituent components in mind. I'd like to note that I haven't pursued any of these courses, minus HSK 5 offered by Peking University.\n\nI hope this is helpful to you! Good luck with your studies in Chinese!

The good news is that I eventually stop making the same old ones and discover fun new ones. This will be a bit long-winded (I'm procrastinating from distance-lesson-planning), but I hope it gives some insight.\n\nThe big mistakes that I made at the beginning were:\n\n- Spending too much trying to decide what language to learn\n\n- Spending too much time trying to decide what IDE to learn on\n\n- Spending too much time trying to decide what book to learn from\n\n- Spending too much time trying to decide what specialty to eventually settle on fifteen years down the line that ALL HINGES ON WHAT I DO RIGHT NOW\n\nSeriously, the biggest hurdle in the beginning is the, \"Holy shit, this is a massive topic. Where do I even begin?\" monolith, and the biggest mistake is letting that paralyze you.\n\nThere are two big questions worth answering before you consider any of the above:\n\n1. **Why are you interested in learning to program?** For instance, do you just find the internet completely fascinating and want to know how it works? Do really like video games and maybe want to build one? Are you interested in working with large sets of data? Do you have an idea for an app? Are you interested in cybersecurity?\n\n2. **How do you prefer to learn?** Do you like online courses? Do you like websites? Video tutorials? Starting a project? Do you need a teacher? Do you like learning from books?\n\nNarrowing down your answer to the first question can give you an idea of what language you should focus on. The second one can help you direct your search for resources.\n\nOnce you've done that, there's are a few realities you'll be faced with which seem overwhelming at first:\n\nFirst, nobody will ever be able to know *everything* about computer science, including you and including me. Accepting that is pretty liberating, because you realizing that learning *whatever you want* is more than not learning any of it at all because there's too much. \n\nNext, *the language you start with doesn't really matter*. All common programming languages have their own specific ways of implementing the same basic concepts (variables, arithmetic, control structures, repetition structures, functions). The big hurdle with (for example) learning loops is not with learning how to *write* them in Java, but learning how to *use them to solve problems*. Once you've muscled your way through developing that new mode of thinking in one programming language, you can learn how to implement a loop in any other programming language. Starting with Python does not somehow lock you out of learning C down the line. You will not go down some irreversible path if you start with the \"wrong\" language, regardless of what opinionated people on stackoverflow say in forum posts from 2008. \n\nOnce you've accepted that, you also realize that all languages can do the basics, but different languages are better-suited for specific tasks, and you'll wind up learning a little bit of a wide variety of languages by just following your interests. Python is great for data science, C++ is great for making games, Java is great for building Android apps, JavaScript is great for building interactive websites, and so on. If you have the basics down, you can learn the language you need to do whatever you want.\n\nFinally, *there is not a one size fits all approach*. I learn best from books because I can unplug and follow along at my own pace. Someone else might learn best from watching tutorial videos on YouTube (there are tons of them). Someone else might learn best by signing up for a Coursera specialization and paying $50/month to guilt trip them into continuing, and someone else might learn best by following a tutorial to clone the Legend of Zelda in C++. It takes some experimenting to figure out what works for you, but some progress is always more than no progress.\n\nSo to answer the first part of your question, the biggest mistake I made was being afraid of making mistakes for so long. Absolutely nothing you can learn right now will somehow lock you out of something that might be a better fit down the line.\n\nTo answer your resources question, I really like textbooks, but I recognize they aren't for everyone. In particular, Tony Gaddis' *Starting Out With* series. He has basically the same book in [C++](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0134498372/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0), [Java](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0134802217/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i3), and [Python](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0134444329/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i1), and I've read all three. I have a degree in math, so I went into this already used to staring at the same page of a book for an hour. Some people don't like textbooks because they are *very* dry and go into excruciating detail on some topics, but dry and technical is exactly how I learn. Bells and whistles actually distract me and prevent me from learning. Note that I said *textbooks*, not *books*. Many of the books you can buy in Barnes &amp; Noble are *not* textbooks. They will get you up and running, but may gloss over some of the very important details, which leaves you out in the cold outside of the very narrowly-defined situation they've built for you. That said, I like Sams and Big Nerd Ranch Guides.\n\nYou can also take introductory courses [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=introduction%20to%20programming), [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/courses/development/) (these are almost always on sale), or even [Harvard](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) through edX. MOOCs are great for being organized and providing level-appropriate challenges, but I've taken a few that were outdated to the point that it broke the course. Read the most recent reviews, particularly if you're looking at Java.\n\nIf you're interested in videos, I'll admit I don't have a lot of reference for those, but there are a lot! People are putting out new videos every day. I'm about to make a bunch of them for the rest of the school year, and I'll probably post them somewhere in case they help someone. New content is created every day.\n\nAlthough I recognize that not everyone learns best from reading, I cannot stress enough how important it is to develop that skill early. Code is not going to read itself to you when you have a problem with it, and reading examples of good code (like you would find in a solid textbook) is absolutely essential to developing good habits. Textbooks are also graded in difficulty\u2013\u2013if you start at the beginning, the programs are short and relatively simple, and they gradually increase in length and complexity. After a certain point, you're going to need to turn to the *documentation* (or the *source code*), which is about as dry and technical as you are going to get.\n\nSo if you've made it this far: What are you interested in doing with programming, and how do you like to learn? I'll scrounge up some more specific resources for you!", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1584506710, "gildings": {}, "id": "fkt5bof", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fkhpnw", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_fksz9ys", "permalink": "/r/Teachers/comments/fkhpnw/you_know_how_we_should_take_days_for_mental/fkt5bof/", "retrieved_on": 1584509060, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Teachers", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqcs", "total_awards_received": 0, "created": 1584506710.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "ibeelicious", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ax68btm", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "  just read your post and I think I have the perfect solution for your problem. Just to give you a little context, I'm 31 now and in the last 5 years, I've been struggling with this feeling of guilt for wasting my time, not being efficient enough, not being smart enough and the stress that resulted from all this negativity really held me back from rising up every day and act, do something instead of just thinking how bad I am at everything.  \nI mentioned this struggle started 5 years ago because it's linked to a big change in my life. I started to work from home and this gave me a freedom I didn't have before. I wasn't accountable to anyone anymore, no boss, no eyes on me, yuppie. Having so much time I used it to read a lot and researched things that interested me. In my mind, I had so many plans to start to write a blog about all the subjects that interested me. I followed great bloggers, read their work and wanted to do that myself but I just kept on consuming information and never took action. Again, thinking I'm not good enough and convincing myself my work will be crap made me procrastinate for years. Don't be like me, please :)  \nThe point of this story was to get to procrastination because that's the problem you and I are facing.  \nIn my desperate need to get over this bad habit, I decided to make a new shift in my life and pick a path that will force me to limit as much as I can screen time. Yes, screen time. Mindlessly reading and surfing the net, facebook, instagram, reddit and all the other loopholes really affected my mood, motivation and mental capacity to act.  \n\n\nSorry for the long post but the best part is coming up so stay with me, please.  \n I realised that this time I need to do things differently if I wanted to get over these bad feelings and I needed to figure out how to do that. I needed to learn how to learn not just consume and not do anything with the info.   \n\n\nSo I searched for a book on this subject and surprise, I found one called exactly like that: \"Learning how to learn\" by Barbara Oakley. Reading it I found answers to most of my questions and understood why I was struggling so hard when I had to do a difficult task. Why I was putting off things I had to do and instead went for the easy things, which always left me feeling guilty.   \nYou'll learn about how the brain works and how you can use it to its full potential by taking baby steps, every day. It's just so good and I highly recommend you read it. Will help you avoid procrastination, retain more from what you learn and to get those assignments done. I wish I knew all of this from a younger age but hey, it's never too late to learn how to learn.   \n\n\nIf you don't feel like reading you can take the online course from Coursera.

Given that this is a worldwide pandemic, it's quite possible that opportunities such as these will be presented again or in an alternative format.  Should they not be, however, you do have some options.\n\nWhen I was an undergrad, I was able to take a graduate-level research methodologies course by virtue of being enrolled in my university's honor college.  You may look into courses of this type available to you on your campus.  If there aren't any, you might inquire w/ other universities, especially those you plan to apply to for graduate school.  \n\nThere are also online research methodologies courses you can partake in.  [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/research-methods?ranMID=40328&amp;ranEAID=a1LgFw09t88&amp;ranSiteID=a1LgFw09t88-WK8b2T5tMzc2zkgL01HIQQ&amp;siteID=a1LgFw09t88-WK8b2T5tMzc2zkgL01HIQQ&amp;utm_content=10&amp;utm_medium=partners&amp;utm_source=linkshare&amp;utm_campaign=a1LgFw09t88) offers a massively-open online course (MOOC) in called Understanding Research Methods that's free of charge.  If you're unfamiliar w/ these courses, they can start at any time, even though it says that, in this particular case, the course begins today.\n\nThe [MOOC List](https://www.mooc-list.com/tags/research-methods?title=research+methods&amp;field_start_date_value_op=between&amp;field_start_date_value%5Bvalue%5D%5Bdate%5D=&amp;field_start_date_value%5Bmin%5D%5Bdate%5D=&amp;field_start_date_value%5Bmax%5D%5Bdate%5D=&amp;sort_by=field_start_date_value&amp;sort_order=DESC) is a website, where you can search for MOOCs.  Oxford University also offers short, professional development courses in [Advanced Qualitative Research Methods](https://www.conted.ox.ac.uk/about/research-methods-and-skills) through their Department for Continuing Education.  Harvard University's Extension School also offers an [Advanced Quantitative Research Methodology](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/advanced-quantitative-research-methodology-0) course.  It appears that it was canceled for Spring 2020 (probably for the same reasons everything else is canceled right now), but it might be worth contacting them to see if it'll run again this summer.  The cost of this course is $1,700, but you do receive degree credit, and I believe that it's entirely online.  Of course, you can probably perform your own Google search in order to come up w/ other, alternative courses.\n\nIf none of this works for/appeals to you, you might consider learning a skill that will be valuable to your future educational path and post-graduate career.  If you plan on studying research-intensive coursework, you would do well learning how to code, if you don't know already.  Python, R, and MATLAB would all be beneficial for you to gain a grasp of, as would Linux.  If the coding/computer skill learning interests you, and you're a bit mystified on where to start, feel free to let me know, and I'll be happy to point you in the proper direction.\n\nI'm sorry that things didn't work out as you planned, but you still have the opportunity to take advantage of the summer months.

That model is what you perceive.\n\nHere's a really good list of articles on thinking with mental models, along with an evolving list of useful mental models: https://fs.blog/mental-models/\n\nAlso there is (or was) a free course on Coursera called Model Thinking or similar that is **outstanding** and doesn't require anything more than the most basic 9th grade algebra concepts in a few places. https://www.coursera.org/learn/model-thinking", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1583070520, "gildings": {}, "id": "fj6frmb", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fberov", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_fj43uuy", "permalink": "/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/fberov/eli5can_someone_explain_what_abstract_reasoning/fj6frmb/", "retrieved_on": 1583070521, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "explainlikeimfive", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sokd", "total_awards_received": 0, "created": 1583070520.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "CassandraCubed", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_fzydv", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "body": "Coursera's [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/)", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1583021182, "gildings": {}, "id": "fj50b4s", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_fblgmi", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_fblgmi", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/fblgmi/what_free_online_course_would_you_recommend/fj50b4s/", "retrieved_on": 1583021184, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "total_awards_received": 0, "created": 1583021182.0}]
