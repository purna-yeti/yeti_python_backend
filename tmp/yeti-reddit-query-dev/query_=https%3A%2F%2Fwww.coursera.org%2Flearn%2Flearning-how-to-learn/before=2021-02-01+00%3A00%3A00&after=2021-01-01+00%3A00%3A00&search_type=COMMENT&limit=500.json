E a regra atual diz que ir pro servi\u00e7o p\u00fablico federal \u00e9 uma boa op\u00e7\u00e3o. Se for no legislativo (qualquer \u00f3rg\u00e3o) ou alguma carreira de estado do executivo, melhor ainda!\n\n\nO resultado vale a pena. Mas pra chegar l\u00e1, tem que saber estudar direcionado pra concurso. E estudar pra concurso \u00e9 diferente de estudar pra saber um conte\u00fado. Fulano pode ser uma pessoa que sabe muita coisa do assunto mas n\u00e3o passa num concurso. E pessoas que sabem bem menos que Fulano podem acabar passando porque estudaram direcionado pra isso. N\u00e3o sei como voc\u00ea est\u00e1 estudando, mas 2 anos com foco 100% era pra ser suficiente pra ter bons resultados (n\u00e3o necessariamente aprova\u00e7\u00e3o).\n\n\nEnt\u00e3o vou deixar aqui uns conselhos que j\u00e1 deixei em outros t\u00f3picos e que pode ser \u00fatil pra voc\u00ea ou pra outros que v\u00e3o estudar pra concursos.\n\n\n1) Compre uma assinatura para um desses sites de quest\u00f5es de concursos. Voc\u00ea j\u00e1 tem acesso as quest\u00f5es de gra\u00e7a indo no site das bancas, mas esses sites v\u00e3o facilitar a sua vida. Vai ser f\u00e1cil filtrar quest\u00f5es por assunto/banca/n\u00edvel etc. Isso vai te economizar tempo e, mais importante, vai ser f\u00e1cil voc\u00ea tirar estat\u00edsticas depois e identificar seus pontos fracos, ou seja, as mat\u00e9rias que voc\u00ea menos acerta.\n\n\n2) Foque nas mat\u00e9rias que s\u00e3o comuns em v\u00e1rios concursos e, principalmente, naquelas que voc\u00ea \u00e9 pior. Se voc\u00ea est\u00e1 com rendimento de 80% em X e 50% em Y, revise sempre X com certa frequ\u00eancia pra n\u00e3o perder seu desempenho mas foque mesmo em Y, afinal estamos atr\u00e1s de pontos. E \u00e9 muito mais f\u00e1cil ganhar pontos nas mat\u00e9rias em que temos os piores resultados!\n\n\n3) Divida a mat\u00e9ria que quer estudar em v\u00e1rios pacotes. Por exemplo, se cai 15 mat\u00e9rias, estude umas 3 ou 4 por dia.\n\n\n4) N\u00e3o estude por horas seguidas. Para cada 50~60min de estudo, fa\u00e7a uma pausa de 10 a 15min. Com o tempo voc\u00ea vai conseguir estudar 90~120min sem perder o foco. Mas as pausas s\u00e3o importantes.\n\n\n5) Antes de estudar o assunto, use o site de quest\u00f5es que assinou para filtrar as quest\u00f5es daquele concurso. D\u00ea uma olhada no que cai e tente resolver algumas. Depois, folheie o livro/apostila e veja o t\u00edtulo das se\u00e7\u00f5es que voc\u00ea vai estudar, legenda das figuras, legenda das tabelas etc. Depois disso, a\u00ed sim voc\u00ea estuda. Quando terminar de estudar o assunto, volte pro site de quest\u00f5es e fa\u00e7a mais quest\u00f5es de concurso: refa\u00e7a as que tinha feito no in\u00edcio e fa\u00e7a mais.\n\n\n6) O site de quest\u00f5es que voc\u00ea est\u00e1 assinando pode e dever ser usado pra direcionar seu estudo. Exemplificando, vamos supor que a banca X lan\u00e7ou o edital e cai a Lei Y. Voc\u00ea n\u00e3o vai tentar decorar a lei Y de cabo a rabo. Isso seria muito bom, mas temos que otimizar o tempo. Ent\u00e3o voc\u00ea vai entrar no site de quest\u00f5es e filtrar por banca X e Lei Y. Fazendo isso, voc\u00ea vai identificar que, por exemplo, 80% das quest\u00f5es caem os artigos x, y, z e w. Esses artigos \u00e9 que devem ser o foco inicial. \n\n\n7) O que voc\u00ea fez no item anterior em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 Lei Y voc\u00ea vai fazer em rela\u00e7\u00e3o a qualquer assunto. Se voc\u00ea for estudar um livro de cada assunto do edital, voc\u00ea n\u00e3o vai muito longe. Voc\u00ea vai filtrar cada assunto no site de quest\u00f5es, dar uma olhada geral no assunto pra entender o macro e depois vai fundo primeiro nos t\u00f3picos que mais aparecem.\n\n\n8) De tempos em tempos \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio revisar as quest\u00f5es. Quando for dormir, j\u00e1 deitado na cama, PENSE no que estudou e tente te contar (em pensamento mesmo) o que voc\u00ea aprendeu. Isso vai fazer com que voc\u00ea revise a mat\u00e9ria e vai ajudar o modo difuso do seu c\u00e9rebro durante o sono. Al\u00e9m disso, lembre que eu disse no item 3 para separar umas 3 ou 4 mat\u00e9rias para estudar por dia, certo? Mas nesses dias, revise as outras que n\u00e3o est\u00e1 estudando (eu sei, isso tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 estudo). A revis\u00e3o pode ser feita atrav\u00e9s de exerc\u00edcios: use o site que voc\u00ea assinou.\n\n\nFazendo isso direitinho \u00e9 muito prov\u00e1vel que voc\u00ea aumente seu percentual de acerto rapidamente. Sugiro fortemente pra todo mundo o curso \"learn how to learn\" no coursera. Ele vai te dar v\u00e1rias dicas boas de estudar: https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn\n\n\n&gt; A mar\u00e9 n\u00e3o est\u00e1 para servidor e sinto que a situa\u00e7\u00e3o pode ser bem ruim em alguns anos, mas investi muito nisso.\n\n\nSobre essa parte, isso \u00e9 uma coisa que s\u00f3 voc\u00ea vai poder dizer. De fato a mar\u00e9 n\u00e3o est\u00e1 pra servidor, mas ainda tem alguns concursos muito bom previstos. De qualquer forma, n\u00e3o se apegue ao \"mas investi muito nisso\". Isso \u00e9 custo afundado, j\u00e1 aconteceu e n\u00e3o tem como mais recuperar. Voc\u00ea tem que olhar daqui pra frente. Esquece o que j\u00e1 foi feito e pensa assim: \"Considerando o estado atual do pa\u00eds, o ponto de conhecimento (e outras coisas) que eu estou agora e o que quero da vida, qual \u00e9 a melhor estrat\u00e9gia que devo adotar?\".", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1611327949, "gildings": {}, "id": "gk6og0i", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_l2c7yo", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_l2c7yo", "permalink": "/r/investimentos/comments/l2c7yo/ainda_vale_a_pena_estudar_para_ser_auditor_da/gk6og0i/", "retrieved_on": 1611458939, "score": 2, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "investimentos", "subreddit_id": "t5_38ilc", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1611327949.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "IWantToLearnBot", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8jb803mb", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Hi, I'm a bot.

This is a somewhat dated book (1990), but a many of my EE friends lived/died by this book. Maybe its a university peculiarity or a field friendliness to the approach, but throwing it out there. The other item I would recommend for getting ML basics is the canonical MOOC https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning \n\nComputer vision has been gobbled up by deep learning in the past few years now, so understanding the latest and greatest CV approaches requires a good foundation of deep learning. Some good free resources I like: [ Michael Nielsen](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) has a great online mini book like review that covers a lot of foundational DL ideas in a very presentable way. There is also the [\"Deep Learning Book\"](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) that is a more academic take - probably going through more detours than you need but very valuable. BIAS SUGGESTION: I'm writing a [book](https://www.manning.com/books/inside-deep-learning?utm_source=raff&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=book_raff_inside_12_22_20&amp;a_aid=raff&amp;a_bid=1faad627) on deep learning that aims to provide a mix of practical utility &amp; intuitive depth. \n\nNow we are at the final level of depth, computer vision specifics! I think [this book](https://szeliski.org/Book/) does a good job at giving an overview of the many different popular CV topics, concepts, and general approaches. I'm not aware of any book resources that really do a good job of showing you how to do/apply them though - but that may be because I'm not a hard core CV person. But once you know the names of the CV approaches, and have some DL under your belt, its not too hard to find implementations available online for most of these methods and you'll be equipped to start reading papers to understand the details of the approaches you need. Some general CV resources I like:\n\nhttps://scikit-image.org/ \nhttps://kornia.github.io/\nhttps://libccv.org/\n\n&gt;Who are the current researchers whose papers I should know to keep in touch with the state of the art?\n\nI don't have any CV researches I follow deeply (again, not my super specialty), but you could browse the results from the major CV conferences. That would be CVPR, ICCV, and ECCV, which generally have their papers freely available [here](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/menu) \n\n&gt; Which are the best schools in this field for hiring talent?\n\nYou could crudley use http://csrankings.org/#/index?vision&amp;us and just sort by computer vision to find which schools are publishing the most, and thus probably have the most CV trained students. But its going to devolve into mostly a ranking of CS schools by prestige. Certainly you can make good hires from there, but I would probably try and hire one or two strong CV people, and then hire for talent from anywhere and train up staff to do that work you need.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1611164096, "gildings": {}, "id": "gjyr8ck", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_l16yvy", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_l16yvy", "permalink": "/r/MachineLearning/comments/l16yvy/dstarting_a_business_line/gjyr8ck/", "retrieved_on": 1611288753, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MachineLearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r3gv", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1611164096.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "thearchitectprincess", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_25c6x537", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Hey u/lfybsai,\n\nIt's okay to rant. Just because other people's situations are objectively less fortunate than yours doesn't mean your problems aren't real or shouldn't be taken seriously.\n\nI wanted to start by commending you for posting here, not because you've been so courageous to share your problems with a bunch of strangers (although that is also noteworthy), but because what you have written shows you have done some thinking and you are acknowledging your problems.\n\nI learned it in engineering, but what is true for the design process is true in life too: the first step to solving *any* problem is acknowledging it, and defining what your problem statement is.\n\nYou've identified some important problems here. You're exhausted by the day-to-day grind of school; you've had to give up your free time and your passions to pursue it. You feel pressured to continue because of how much time and effort you've put into it, and you are worried you won't have a financially stable future if you don't continue to pursue it. And you feel bad because you know there are other people who would give anything to be in your position.\n\nThese are all valid concerns. Let's address them one by one.\n\n\\~\\~ Extracurriculars \\~\\~\n\nI'm not particularly familiar with the schooling system in Germany, but does your school offer any extracurricular activities? I know you might feel like you don't have enough time for it, but sometimes finding an extracurricular activity that is tangentially related to your field of study can be a good way to destress whilst still engaging in something you can \"justify\" using your time on, since it's related experience in the field. Look for clubs, internships, job-shadowing and community service opportunities. If you can't find one, you can always start one. Here in the States, for instance, there are programmes started by high school students and college students, which aim to engage small children at primary schools with their fields of study.\n\n\\~\\~ Study Habits\\~\\~\n\nYou mentioned that you get home pretty late, around 5pm, and that you spend the rest of your day studying. You also mentioned that your grades are \"still bad.\" Has this been an issue for you throughout school, or is it something that has presented itself only as things have gotten more specialised?\n\nRegardless, there are probably more time-efficient and effective ways to study, in addition to what you are doing now.\n\nIf you aren't clear on it yet, you should definitely try and figure out what type of learning style works best for you. [Here's an article](https://www.rasmussen.edu/student-experience/college-life/most-common-types-of-learners/) explaining the different learning styles, and [here's a quiz](https://arden.ac.uk/what-type-learner-are-you) you can take that might help you find out.\n\nFrom there, there are a lot of more specific studying tips and strategies that you can employ, some of which may help you. If you're interested in hearing more about this, I would be happy to fill you in.\n\n\\~\\~ Staying Motivated \\~\\~\n\nIt's hard. It really is. Never feel bad for being \"privileged\"; it's not your fault that you are and other people aren't. But as a privileged person, the best thing you can do is to recognise that privilege and use the opportunities that are presented to you to their greatest potential.\n\nTry your best in everything you do, but also don't kill yourself over it. There's a certain point where it's better to get some sleep so you'll wake up refreshed enough to retain new information, rather than staying up trying to get something absolutely perfect.\n\nAlways ask for help feedback, from anyone, whether that's a teacher, a classmate, a friend, a family member. Consider it objectively, and don't take any of it personally. If there's anything I've learned studying architecture, it's that critiques are about *your work*, and no matter how important your work is to you, **it** **doesn't reflect your worth as a person**.\n\nThe occasional compliment can be really encouraging. And you seem like the type of person who is eager to do better when you recognise what can be done better. So the constructive feedback should help as well.\n\n\\~\\~ Fighting Boredom\\~\\~\n\nRoutines can get boring. Even if you don't feel like you have the time to do it, there are a million little things you can do to enrich your life, and make things more interesting or unpredictable.\n\nAs someone pursuing a creative degree, I've come to understand that even if your day-to-day life is mundane, if you fill it with new *stuff*, you will always be surrounded by new ideas, some of which are inspiring and help you look towards the future.\n\nWhat are you passionate about? What have you had to give up on, that you are really interested in?\n\nKeeping up with the news about it can help. There are some amazing new things being developed, invented, and created every single day. You can't know what you like/don't like, or what your life's passions are if you don't discover it.\n\nSo get out there. Learn stuff!\n\n[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and [edX](https://www.edx.org/) are great places to start if you are interested in auditing or taking online classes (you can pay for a certificate, or just watch the video lessons for free). [A TED talk](https://www.ted.com/) or [TED-Ed animation](https://ed.ted.com/) is no more than 20 minutes tops (usually shorter, within the 10 minute range), and is a great avenue for learning about new things.\n\nPodcasts are great, too! [Encylocpedia Womannica](https://open.spotify.com/show/0WXHcjuxPw7kmbmH2klfPY) is one about remarkable women throughout history, and can be a source of inspiration to you. [Freakonomics](https://freakonomics.com/archive/) is quirky and fun, and [Radiolab](https://open.spotify.com/show/2hmkzUtix0qTqvtpPcMzEL) is another popular choice.\n\nThere's great books and great stuff on YouTube as well.\n\n\\~\\~ The Future \\~\\~\n\nIf you're not happy where you are (or where you're headed) and you don't feel like health/medicine is for you, then don't feel discouraged. It's not the *only* choice that will give you financial security.\n\nI know it can be scary, since you've already put so much time and effort into it (this is what is known as the \"sunk cost fallacy\"), but you're actually in a pretty good place right now. It's a lot better to find out sooner rather than later, right?\n\nIt never hurts to do some self-reflection, to ask yourself *why* you're pursuing what you're doing. If you're just doing it for the money, and the passion is gone, then you will probably be miserable working in the field too, especially with something like health/medicine where you're working long, random hours and dealing with delicate matters of life and death.\n\nIf you're starting to feel some doubt, [a career test](https://www.careerexplorer.com/) is a good place to start rethinking your search for a career that is worthwhile to you.\n\n\\~\\~ Final Words of Encouragement \\~\\~\n\nI know you are having a hard time, and you feel overwhelmed by everything that's coming. The important thing to remember is that you don't have to fix/decide everything all at once. Take it day by day, assignment by assignment.\n\nIf you can focus on even just ONE thing each day - getting enough sleep, finishing *that* assignment...you're making progress.\n\nYou'll do great. You'll be okay.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1611106456, "gildings": {}, "id": "gjwbcv5", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_l0xf6d", "locked": false, "no_follow": false, "parent_id": "t3_l0xf6d", "permalink": "/r/helpme/comments/l0xf6d/school_is_kinda_killing_me_help/gjwbcv5/", "retrieved_on": 1611232367, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "helpme", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qpmh", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1611106456.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "IWantToLearnBot", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8jb803mb", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Hi, I'm a bot.

Learn Python and create a program that does something you can be proud of. Collect your own data and build a machine learning model you can be proud of.

In fact spaced repition is a key part of how we learn things. Two, highlighting things on your Kindle may be causing an illusion of competence; that is to say that you *think* you're retaining information simply because you've highlighted it or taken notes. Three, I've never thought about this problem in particular but the first thing that comes to mind is recall. That is to take notes or question yourself *after* listening. That's one way you'll change passive listening into active learning.\n\nOne last thing: use your brain for creativity, not memory. Don't try and be a library.

I would recommend against a Bootcamp.  Coding Bootcamps tend to be focused on getting you up and running in a particular industry and are usually specific to a framework or tool-chain.  If you wanted to crank out websites using Rails or React, then a Bootcamp can help you tune out some of the complexity and focus on the core tasks necessary to create a minimal project.  I've seen a few Bootcamps for 3D modelling.  Ultimately someone is holding your hand in order to minimize the time it takes you to produce something tangible.  They aren't great for deep learning.\n\nYou have two tasks before you:\n\n1. Building Stuff in Unity\n2. Learning Basic CompSci\n\nMy suggestion is to approach these separately.  You won't be making use of data-structures / algorithms at all during the initial stages of learning Unity development.  Mostly you will be following tutorials on YouTube and getting familiar with the Unity Editor, setting up your IDE (likely Visual Studio or VSCode) and learning the fundamentals of C#.  I suggest choosing a very simple type of game which interests you and look for tutorials - you'll find plenty.  This will be rewarding.\n\nFor data-structures and algorithms, you'll want to either take an online course or just start working through an introductory textbook.  These topics are largely independent of a particular language, so go with whatever you are most comfortable with.  Some books use pseudo-code which you can then translate into Python or JavaScript or Java, whichever has the least amount of friction for you.  It makes sense to use C# if you're aiming for Unity.  In the past decades most CS departments converged on Java for these introductory classes, and the languages are so similar that those resources will be very helpful.\n\n[Udemy Data Structures &amp; Algorithms - C#](https://www.udemy.com/course/algorithms-data-structures-csharp)\n\n[Coursera Data Structures... for Game Developers](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-design-patterns#syllabus) (Starts Jan. 2nd)\n\nFor practicing these concepts independently I recommend CodeWars: https://www.codewars.com/\n\nSplit your time between these two tasks for the first 4-6 weeks.  After that you can use your toy game as a test-bed for the things you learn in the course.  Ideally as you work through data-structures / algos, you'll want to ask yourself \"How might this be useful in a game?\"  Try to imagine as many applications as possible for every structure you encounter.\n\nThrough programming generally you will get an intuitive sense over time for when certain structures are useful.  Notably the most used structures are baked into any modern languages and you will use them without even noticing as you follow tutorials.  Do you think a Linked List might be a useful for an inventory system?  Find a simple inventory system tutorial on YouTube.  It will almost certainly use a List in the code.  Take the data structure you wrote from your Udemy/Coursera course and copy/paste it in.  Try adding functionality to your game using your own data structure implementations.\n\nDid you make a 2D space shooter?  Add some collectable weapon upgrades and manage them.  Are you making a top-down adventure game?  Add arrows and potions.  Does your course feature a sorting algorithm?  Try sorting the items in your inventory by cost, or weight, or damage.\n\nThere's a book called [Data Structures for Game Programmers](https://www.amazon.com/Structures-Programmers-Premier-Development-CD-ROM/dp/1931841942) if you need some inspiration.

My background, I had finished a BS in Math from a small state school when I was 28, I was going off and on since I was 19, finally buckled down and finished, and actually did very well in the higher level theoretical classes. Honestly, always had trouble with school, grew up very poor with a single mom, had been working odd jobs since I was 16. Even with the degree, I was not making more then $35k/year, there's just not much you can do with theoretical math and a small state school is not very impressive.\n\nSo, I just started self studying. I had taken a class in Python and SQL in college, but barely knew anything, like I couldn't even write a for loop. Read a few books, found some online resources, started practicing coding problems on Hackerrank, followed some tutorials. After about 4 months, I could solve the  easy level Hackerrank problems which were honestly quite a bit easier then most Leetcode easy problems are today. I had been studying C#/.NET, started applying to junior .NET positions.\n\n4 months later, I had a few interviews and one of them I got an offer. I barely knew anything, but I didn't even really have a technical interview, I just talked to the manager and he loved to hear himself talk and I just went along with whatever he said.\n\nThe job was writing ETL scripts to load data from ERP's of companies we bought into our ERP, and then helping out with the ERP web app when I had nothing else to do. I struggled a ton at first, was really stressful, I basically got a talk from the manager about how I needed to improve fast, and I did. I only stayed in that position for like 6 months, got a promotion and a big raise, then job hopped for another raise, and in less then 2 years I was making 6 figures.\n\nSo, no Ivy League education, no outside support, just reading stuff on the internet and practicing. It didn't take long, but it was extremely difficult, and if I'm being honest I'm a lot smarter and learn a lot faster then those around me most of the time. The math degree did help, in that I was really good at reading dense texts and learning on my own, and the type of math in CS is kind of easy in comparison.\n\nCan a lot of people do it? Probably not; honestly getting a CS degree is probably the easiest way to do it as they bring you up slowly. Also, most places won't hire you without a degree, so if you don't already have one you should probably just go get a CS degree. But, if you are like me, had a degree and it's not working out for you, and you have a knack for analytical thinking, you can definitely pick up what you need to know and get a 6 figure job within a couple years.\n\nFor the books, I'd say no. Take Harvard [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2021/spring/). It's a legit Harvard class that's an intro to CS, starts with Scratch programming, works you up to C, then ends with a web project in a 12 week course. I did not take this course starting out, but I knew people who did and honestly it would have been a great place to start. After that, you should be able to start looking for a job, but also take Stanford's course on [Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms) while you are applying. This will get you ready for Leetcode. And after that?
