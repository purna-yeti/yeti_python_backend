Learning how to program can be difficult and frustrating at times. This is a normal part of the process in learning anything technical. Do not be so hard on yourself and remember that as time goes on, your ability to learn and understand new technical ideas will improve, as will your problem solving skills. \n\nI'd recommend that you try to mostly focus on your own growth and not the growth of other people. Just do you. If you are driven to learn, then you will make progress and improve.\n\nTry different approaches when learning a difficult concept by checking out other resources such as different websites, books, videos, etc. Usually you can find an explanation that makes sense to you and 'clicks' just by spending a little bit of time searching.\n\nHere are 2 other important things that will help:\n\nFirst, spend some time thinking about the learning process and how you learn best. Many of us have never been taught strong skills used for learning new information and really don't know how to go about doing so in an efficient way. Here is a great course on this subject from Coursera.\n\nhttps://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn\n\nSecond, spend some time learning problem solving skills. Knowing how to approach and break down problems in a logical way is one of the best skills you can have. These skills can be applied to learning as well as to many different areas in your life.\n\nHere are 2 courses on this subject:\n\nThis one is aimed at people who are  learning programming\nhttps://www.mooc-list.com/course/logic-and-computational-thinking-edx\n\nhttps://www.coursera.org/learn/problem-solving\n\nI hope this helps. Don't worry about your learning speed. You'll know in time whether programming will workout, and it will mostly be dependent on your ambition and how passionate you are about the field. You do not need a higher than average IQ to learn how to code. Instead, you need patience, learning and problem solving skills, focus  and most of all, practice, practice, practice.\n\nGood luck!", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1598910696, "gildings": {}, "id": "g3ircce", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ijy24o", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_ijy24o", "permalink": "/r/learnprogramming/comments/ijy24o/failure_to_understand_a_simple_for_loop_might/g3ircce/", "retrieved_on": 1598918331, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "learnprogramming", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r7yd", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1598910696.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "Trailblazer-", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6ytokgou", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Is not that accounting is hard, is just that learning accounting requires a lot discipline because the concepts does not easily get cemented into people\u2019s mind.

It's a frustrating thing right? The essence of all progress is, well, learning. I definitely collide with this feeling often of not getting out what I want to from my efforts.\n\nYSK Theres an amazing course on Coursera called [\"Learning How to Learn\"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) created by a neuroscientist, and a engineering professor, which breaks down the techniques and knowledge behind how we learn best. It's free, if you take it without a certificate. (I took it one summer, and it changed how I looked at guitar playing). I recommend you look there if you are serious, I'm sure it will open up a world of ideas to you... \n\nFor now, here is my solicited advice:\n\n**Application over Study-** 80/20 mix. Reading isn't practice. It's a resource that can be crafted and called upon during application of effort, and at times help you create novel solutions or see a bigger picture. But it's not the thing itself. If you want to learn **Deeply** instead of superficially as is your complaint, you'll need to apply a concept. Open up terminal or a python interpreter and test out a concept you are reading about. Change the variables and inputs around. See if you still understand how to apply the concept as you manipulate different elements. This will cause you to understand it, and will deliver skill. This is the way. There is no other.\n\nand...\n\n**Repetition is everything. But Rest is a big part of that recipe**... I used to think of practice/study like pushing a boulder along a path; when I got to a tough spot in the road where I couldn't heft the boulder, I might give up and assume that was my limit as an individual. Tomorrow i'll try again, but if I overcome it will be through sheer will, effort, or luck that I get past the obstacle and continue along the path... **turns out that's not quite right.** Your mind continues to work on projects you've grappled with during the day as you sleep... it organizes pathways you made an effort to fire throughout the day, and makes them more efficient as you sleep. In essence you will wake up, walk over to the path, and the boulder will be a little lighter, or roll a little easier than yesterday. **Repetition and rest in combination can overcome obstacles that seem like a hard impasse, even if it seems like an hard stop.** \n\n...**And Don't be so hard on yourself.** really. Remember that if you are applying yourself diligently, and resting, you will progress. You don't need to white knuckle things. \n\n\\-", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1598602068, "gildings": {}, "id": "g345b09", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ihwvs4", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_ihwvs4", "permalink": "/r/IWantToLearn/comments/ihwvs4/iwtl_how_to_learn_at_all_like_seriously/g345b09/", "retrieved_on": 1598602079, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1598602068.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "watnouwatnou", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1twpxuv", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "That!: [https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1598592826, "gildings": {}, "id": "g33v0gm", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ihwvs4", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_g33udjh", "permalink": "/r/IWantToLearn/comments/ihwvs4/iwtl_how_to_learn_at_all_like_seriously/g33v0gm/", "retrieved_on": 1598595668, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1598592826.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "Son_Of_Wu", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_h8rk9", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "One of the best resources available:  \n\n\nLearning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects  \n\n\n [https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1598484873, "gildings": {}, "id": "g2ysshe", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ih7gpn", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_ih7gpn", "permalink": "/r/IWantToLearn/comments/ih7gpn/iwtl_how_to_learn/g2ysshe/", "retrieved_on": 1598490732, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1598484873.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "bjzaba", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "1ca7b952-b89e-11e6-99d0-0e9196c7f09c", "author_flair_text": "Pikelet, Fathom", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6967a", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "I found [this course on coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages) really helped me when it came to learning how to learn new programming languages, no matter how obscure.

Free, about six hours long. Hosted by the National Child Traumatic Stress Network and promoted by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. \n\nYou learn how to help disaster survivors get referenced to the professionals they need and how to triage those with more damaging psychological distress before it gets worse. Learn the signs, symptoms, etc., and know where to forward the survivors to the proper agencies. Additionally there are some things on how to secure relief sites in consideration for physical and mental health.\n\nThere are also free courses on the website regarding helping children and military families with specific issues, but since I have not taken them yet I cannot comment on those classes.\n\nThe course is tailored to the U.S., but the ideas should be easily applicable anywhere. Anyone may register for a class online and take it at their own pace. If there are any issues, please let me know so I may update this post.\n\nPsychological First Aid is more designed towards a large-scale response. For individual psychological training, consider the [QTR Institute](https://www.qprinstitute.com/professional-training) which trains you in suicide prevention techniques in multiple different settings and environments.

It might feel more rewarding to put checkmarks / crosses on paper than in an app and it doesn't create digital distractions like an app. And [here is that student' comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/BasicBulletJournals/comments/f8fdxf/medical_student_bullet_journal_with_heavy_use_of/fil01ld/) with additional explanations.\n* There are also apps like **Forest** and Tide that people seem to use for studying with the Pomodoro technique, with great success. \n\n**#2** Check out relevant excerpts from Atomic Habits by James Clear *(apparently, it's a go-to book about habit building these days; I see it recommended everywhere, it seems).*\n\n* Why it's more effective to make your habits (e.g. the habit of studying in a particular way) *identity-based:* https://jamesclear.com/identity-based-habits\n* How to deal with Akrasia effect: https://jamesclear.com/akrasia The section called *The Framework You Need to Beat Procrastination* offers a plan of action *for your situation,* divided into 3 parts:\n  * Strategy 1: Design your future actions.\n  * Strategy 2: Reduce the friction of starting.\n  * Strategy 3: Utilize implementation intentions.\n\nThere is actually a related model, for dealing with bad triggers:\n\n1. Anticipate (prepare your plan of action if bad triggers flare up).\n2. Avoid (figure out what you can do to avoid/eliminate bad triggers).\n3. Adjust (correct your actions to incorporate your lessons learned *the hard way,* i.e. after making a mistake). \n\nIt's from the book called *Triggers. Creating Behavior That Lasts.* by a reputable executive coach.\n\n**#3** There was [this great post with instructions](https://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/et53p0/how_i_studied_89_hours_a_day_for_6_weeks/) in this /r/GetStudying sub about how to study a lot for 6 weeks in a row without burning out.\n\nThe author overdid the hydration thing though. But staying hydrated IS important, yes. It, subjectively, increases your energy levels (it's especially noticeable when you drink 1-2 glasses in the morning, when you are dehydrated from many hours of sleep), but also: **\"Being dehydrated by just 2%** impairs performance in tasks that require **attention,** psychomotor, **and immediate memory skills\"** ([source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22855911/)) Also: if you feel thirsty, it means you are ALREADY in the dehydrated state.\n\n**#4** Decrease your \"workload\" by making your studying more effective &amp; efficient, and postpone the burnout in *that* way. \n\nThere are neuroscience-based recommendations for effective &amp; efficient studying. E.g. check out the following reference files that are adapted from the books that a popular &amp; free online course on Coursera, [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn), is based on (in the course materials the lecturers provide the links to the supporting research studies):\n\n* 10 rules of good studying and 10 rules of bad studying ([this 2-page PDF](http://www.math.toronto.edu/nhoell/10rules-of-studying.pdf)).\n* a somewhat different version for kids &amp; teens ([this 2-page PDF](https://barbaraoakley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-Top-Ideas-to-Help-Your-Learning-and-10-Pitfalls-1.pdf)).\n\nAlso, check out **Learning Pyramid** in the beginning of [this article](https://mcgrawect.princeton.edu/what-is-passive-learning-and-how-to-avoid/) on Princeton University' site.\n\n**#5** Consider decreasing the length of your Pomodoro session.\n\nE.g. the recommendation for the original Pomodoro technique is 25 minutes.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1598339074, "gildings": {}, "id": "g2s0iw7", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ig0yc0", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_ig0yc0", "permalink": "/r/GetStudying/comments/ig0yc0/i_really_struggle_to_complete_my_tasks/g2s0iw7/", "retrieved_on": 1598339086, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "GetStudying", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tl44", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1598339074.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "Son_Of_Wu", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_h8rk9", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": " [https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1598320239, "gildings": {}, "id": "g2r9s9v", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ifoy10", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_ifoy10", "permalink": "/r/davidgoggins/comments/ifoy10/im_going_to_approach_a_goggins_way_to_study/g2r9s9v/", "retrieved_on": 1598325375, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "davidgoggins", "subreddit_id": "t5_g0oyq", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1598320239.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "ferrelhadley", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6jf42qcy", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": " [https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) \n\n [u/RezervedXin](https://www.reddit.com/user/RezervedXin/)", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1598261157, "gildings": {}, "id": "g2oc2vf", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_if1ktk", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_if1ktk", "permalink": "/r/history/comments/if1ktk/how_to_remember_history_when_school_teacher_makes/g2oc2vf/", "retrieved_on": 1598261168, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "history", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh53", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1598261157.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "pianobutter", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5qdxz", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Enroll in Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski's [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn). \n\nOakley went from studying Russian as a mathphobe to a PhD in engineering.

Idk where you are in your process, but just keep that in mind. \n\nThe first video, \"Basic Facts 01\" is a good video that goes over the basics. He discusses trademark selection challenges &amp; how to search the database to ensure your mark isn't already registered at around the 15 min mark. He also discusses what to look for and ask when hiring an attorney to file a trademark application for you toward the end, around 30 mins in, and I'd check that out if you're really interested to make sure you've covered your bases with your lawyer friend who's offered to do this. \n\nHowever, I still wouldn't really worry about it until you're really promoting your music and getting out there (like on radio/larger venues, at least regional tours, or when you start needing sponsors and stuff). The likelihood of someone 'stealing' your name is very low right now, and will probably remain so for a while. I'd make a goal of 'play x amount of gigs' or 'get over x number of facebook/social media followers' or 'sell x number of tshirts/merch' or 'sell out a venue of x number of people' or 'play on the radio' or 'get x number of streams' before I would put money toward reserving a trademark.\n\nNow for the domain: \n\nIt sounds like the domain you want is already registered by a reseller or squatter. I would not recommend paying that amount for a domain at this time.. maybe if your band hits it big, but even then you could use \"stonetssband.com\", \"stonetssmusic.com\", \"stonetss.band\", or any number of variations that are available. Same goes for your social tags, which it sounds like you've done. Your fans will figure it out.. they're probably using links to find you anyway. When you're ready for it, you'll be able to sort out the SEO later. \n\nTo check if a name is available, go to your computer terminal/console and type \"whois mydomain.tld\" (see: [here](https://www.engadget.com/2008-03-13-terminal-tip-using-whois.html)). You want the query to return \"no match for domain\" (see: [here](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/epp-status-codes-2014-06-16-en)), which means it's available to register. If it returns with a bunch of registration info, check the status. If it says \"Active\", keep searching &amp; trying variations in the terminal until you get one that is available. If you see something like 'pendingdelete' or 'redemptionperiod', that means the domain may expire from it's current registration and become available, and you may want to research dropcatching the name to get it... but that's a whole 'nother post (I had to do this.. it was a pain and a half!). If it's simply marked 'ok' or 'transferprohibited', that means it's already registered by someone else (or a squatter/reseller) and is in good standing, so they probably won't just let it expire, and you probably won't get a chance to scoop it up later, so I'd move on. It's not that important to have the perfect domain... most people aren't looking for you on a website anyway, and if they are, they're finding you via a link.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI get that it's hard to find stuff to do while waiting on recording, especially during this time when gigs are so limited. If you want to be ready to hit the ground running, I think the better use of your time is to start learning about SEO and how to promote yourself, and make a bandcamp page for free so your stuff can go straight on there when it's ready. Also, look into distribution stuff (like how distrokid works &amp; how to get your stuff on streaming platforms/where/how you want to promote your music). There's tons of resources on here for that. Find fb/social media groups for musicians in your area or genre and start networking that way if you can't go out and see people/play. They'll be your first resource for promoting your album when it's finished.\n\nMaybe work on some visual art to use for album covers, t-shirts/merch, or social/website designs, or work on a logo if you need a break from practicing or producing on your own (or reach out to other artists who could create this with you if you don't want to create it yourself.) When I get burned out playing, it's helpful to look into ways to express my band's identity through other mediums, so I stay semi-productive, and maybe learn more about what I want my band to be and stand for. \n\nAnd there's nothing wrong with just practicing like a maniac and working up your skills. Maybe try a new style or genre that you're not already great with, which could lead to new songs. I took a free Berkley online class through [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/songwriting-lyrics) last winter, which really helped jumpstart my lyric writing, that might be a good change of pace too if you're burnt out playing and feel like you're just waiting around.

When you are calm &amp; relaxed, you can learn a lot.\n\nFew things that helped me:\n\n1. \\[For helping with distraction\\] **Listen to instrumental music** (classical or not) or some nice movie theme music (Dunkirk &amp; Interstellar) -- this should help get FOCUS.\n2. \\[For helping you keep moving\\] **Make a plan** \n   1. ...about what you would like to learn. Sometimes, grasping the basics goes a long way to helping you understand the other concepts. Its ok to go slow. **ASK Questions** (its ok to not know something). Make notes. Draw diagrams, etc. I had a rule that for every topic, I would ask 10 questions, and try to answer them myself... If you cant find the answer, talk to study partners/profs/ta's/google.\n   2. Once you have broken down the topics to learn, use pomodoro technique to **manage your time****.**.. Pomodoro or study session of 40-50mins can be greatly helpful in pacing your studies... That way, you could have a pact with yourself, that you wont get up and leave halfway until you finish your 40-50 min. i I try to get 4-5 pomodoros each day (some folks do 10 or more). There are also apps like forest, etc. Try Cornell notes too.\n   3. When you find yourself procrastinating - understand why. It could be because its painful to deal with the present (the unpleasant). \"**Delay the gratification**\" got by watching netflix or playing games, until you finish your task -- quoting from \"Road less travelled\". **Visualize** yourself doing the task in your mind. Once the mind has seen it/done it, it becomes doable. **Meditate -** ease your stress. \n3. **Try to see the larger picture:** I once watched a coursera module about [\"Learning how to learn\"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)... It is pretty short (like 1-2 hrs)... If you dont have time, the gist is to learn smaller nuggets of information and fit it into a larger picture.... and using active recall - like thinking about the topic while you walk/jog, etc. ALWAYS TRY TO SEE THE LARGER PICTURE\n4. **How to stick to plan when you feel frustrated after 10-15 min of flipping thru?** First off, its ok to go slow. Relax. Play it like a game... Each topic that was foreign to me, I used to have a running commentary in my mind.. \"Ok, now, thats how I am going to demystify this topic\". ... I used to pretend to be a game show host, or like Sherlock holmes trying to understand the topic's mystery. Remember, if you can understand the why's and how's of a topic, you will automatically gain depth into the topic. The deeper you go, the less mysterious it becomes. Everything is hard before it becomes easy.\n5. \\[For helping with your frustration\\] - Its nice to have an emotional support - be it a sibling or parent or a friend - try talking... That should help ease the stress a little bit. If possible, find a study partner, and hold yourself accountable. Try to teach an imaginary friend - it does wonders, trust me. Or, talk to yourself, by using a video log.\n\nI did my masters in computer science. I had majored in electrial engineering in my undergrad, so, switching to CS and that too for masters was a bit of challenge. The above helped. Dont give up. I know the struggle is real...

Does that make sense?\n\nMnemonic exercises are also very good for this.

If you're really set on Java I recommend this course from the University of Helsinki that teaches [Java Programming](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/) and covers object-oriented programming, testing, intro to algorithms etc. After that you could go into backend development or making mobile apps/Android development using Java etc. You mentioned not knowing algorithms/data structures so you could follow that up with this free [DSA book in Java](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-data-structures/) or this free 2-part course on [Algorithms in Java](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1).\n\nThe web development field is also a good option for the self-taught route as there are loads of jobs and you can host your projects/web apps online and showcase them in a portfolio website. If you already have prior programming experience this course on [Full Stack Web Development](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) teaches how to create web applications with React, Express, Node and MongoDB aka MERN which is a very in demand tech stack and all of which use the JavaScript language. If you get stuck anywhere on the concepts I've always found the [MDN web dev section](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) to be pretty helpful, and they have great documentation as well. There are also resources out there for learning DSA using JavaScript such as this [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/t2CEgPsws3U)\n\nAll the resources I've linked are free, so the only limit is your own time and effort. Get a solid grasp of a programming language, build a few decent projects to showcase on your resume/portfolio, and I'd say you'd be in a good spot for landing a junior development role.

This is what I do to help me (I can't always do all of this, but I try):\n\nI hope you have motivation to read this long text. \ud83d\ude02\n\n\\- Go to bed early and wake up early, but sleep well. I've seen lots of people who follow that book \"Morning Miracle\"... it says that having the habit of waking up at 5 in the morning can change your life. I can confirm that it at least brings a lot of motivation and makes your day much more productive. When I have important projects, exams, I wake up at 5-6, it's really a big change in motivation.\n\n\\- Organize your house, your room, the place of study, the night BEFORE and organize all your study materials, books, even the page open prepared for the morning. \n\n\\- Use an app to track your time (I use Boosted, it gives me statistics of my hours). I soon as I sit down to study, I press play and during that time I don't allow myself to do anything else.\n\n\\- Set a timer, an alarm. You could try the well-known Pomodoro technique (try to be highly focused for 25 min, then take a break of 5 minutes, give yourself a reward and go on).  For me, 25 min is too short... If I take a break every 25 min, chances are I won't come back for the next 25 min after a couple of sessions. I prefer longer sessions of 1h30 - 2 hours, so I have less chance to give up.\n\n\\- Take cold showers in between study sessions. It's like a way to \"reset\" your brain and give you new energy. Coffee also helps.\n\n\\- Do physical exercises in between study sessions. \n\n\\- Get rid of all distractions and addictions... like Reddit and social media. Use some blocker. \n\n\\- Often search about study techniques, learn how to use Anki, take the course LEARN HOW TO LEARN. They teach you how to find motivation. For example, they say it's scientifically observed that the \"pain\" or discomfort of not wanting to work only lasts for the first couple of minutes. Once you force yourself to start, the discomfort goes away fast.

NAND and NOR gates are universal logic gates. What this means is that they can be used to implement any other logic element. Memory, Adders, Frequency multipliers, muxes, demuxes, and on an on can all be implemented with these gates. Essentially, this means theoretically, you could built any sort of digital component out of a set of universal gates. By extension, an FPGA could, in theory, implement any other computing system assuming the chip contained enough gates, programming space, and IO to meet the requirements of the system.\n\nAs an aside, if you'd like to take a course that does just this -- that is, walks you through building a computer all the way from fundamental gates through a working OS, I highly recommend [this course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer). It's easily one of the best of it's kind out there.\n\nAnyways, back to gaming systems. So, let's apply this to the Genesis. The Genesis has two main sound chips the [sn76489an](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_SN76489), which is used to generate \"noise\" and the [YM2612/YM3438](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_YM2612) which is for FM sound (e.g. music). Well, here are github repos for each chip [jt98 \\(sn76489an\\)](https://github.com/jotego/jt89) and [jt12 \\(YM2612/YM3438\\)](https://github.com/jotego/jt12). If you look through the code, you'll find that these exact implementations are used in the [Genesis MiSTer FPGA](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Genesis_MiSTer) core. These chips are implemented in a language called \"Verilog\" (look at the .v files in the hdl directories). This is very different from your average programming language. This is not software that is running on a processor executing line by line. Instead, this language is used by the FPGA to literally arrange the logic gates in the FPGA to more or less assemble the chip you're trying to create. It's as close to a replica of the actual chip as you can get without printing one.\n\nSo, why is all this important? Well, there are a few reasons:\n\n* Just like real hardware, all operations are ran simultaneously. There is no need to worry about ensuring each line of code is executed within some specific window b/c there is no code or execution sequence\n* Various chips can be clocked to their specific frequency and each runs independently. There is no need to \"get close enough\" or make hard decisions on which element of the system gets the most attention from the CPU as there is no CPU.\n* Each individual component in the system can be implemented individually and tested to determine how closely it's characteristics match the original. Once it's fully characterized and validated, the work is mostly done. That chip can now be used for pretty much anything out there that uses it (not just game systems, but synths or pc sound cards as well to continue with the sound chip example).\n* Once you're familiar with the language, implementation can be pretty straight forward. For example, the YM2612 has many variants, all of which are already implemented in the repo above. This implementation is used in NeoGeo, Megadrive, and PC88 arcade systems. So unlike software emulation, where it's often difficult to re-use implementations while maintaining accuracy, this really isn't an issue on FPGAs. If someone else already implemented it, just grab it and use it and it'll likely work.\n* Because the FPGA is implementing the hardware directly, you often get all of the undocumented features (aka bugs) as well. While cycle accurate emulators tend to end up adding hacks on top of hacks to improve compatibility and accuracy, FPGA implementations tend to be more of an either it works or doesn't situation depending on whether the chip is fully implemented.\n\nThere's more, but you get the point. I'm of the opinion that FPGAs are the future of emulation. They are easier to implement, give better results, are easier to maintain, and are great for preservation. While they aren't 100% an exact match for the physical hardware (some erroneously claim they are), it's as close as you'll get. Finally, the last awesome thing about FPGAs is that the verilog code used to make these chips can literally be given to a fab house to produce physical units. So, eventually, as fab costs come down, it might be feasible for mom and pop shops to produce actual systems using these code bases.\n\nAgain, the learning curve is steep, but if you're serious about emulation, it can be a lot of fun. The only reason this hasnt happened sooner is that FPGAs used to require 10s of thousands of dollars for the software tools and devkits. That's no longer the case.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1596827681, "edited": 1596828148.0, "gildings": {}, "id": "g0pmwb1", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_i59oil", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_g0pevgh", "permalink": "/r/EmuDev/comments/i59oil/does_emulators_use_embedded_systems_if_so_how_do/g0pmwb1/", "retrieved_on": 1596833002, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EmuDev", "subreddit_id": "t5_37zrk", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1596827681.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "SoWhatsNextDoc", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2c2ufth5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "body": "Your problem is that it's hard for you to start new things if you aren't able to attach them in some way to your existing knowledge base.

For **testing yourself,** you don't necessarily have to make flash cards\u2026 You can take your notes so that to have Active Recall questions there in a separate column (or maybe list them on a separate page). Cornell Notes template is used for the first option.  [This image](https://i.redd.it/d9cd0idpxs651.jpg) is a how-to for the Cornell method *at a glance,* and [this PDF](https://shp.utmb.edu/asa/Forms/cornell%20note%20taking%20system.pdf) has more explanations and real examples. [Wikipedia article(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_Notes) and [Cornell's site](http://lsc.cornell.edu/notes.html) also have solid instructions. \n2. For **spaced repetition:** check out *retrospective timetables.* Engaging explanations &amp; demo: 12:04-17:10 of [this video](https://youtu.be/ONG26-2mIHU?t=724). Ali (he was a *medical student at Cambridge* and is now a working doctor who also teaches some seminars? courses? at Cambridge) shows how he does them in Notion *(apparently, it's free for students),* but you'll see that you can also do it *in a paper notebook,* i.e. without exposing yourself to digital distractions. And I like his explanations of why he uses retrospective timetables instead of \"prospective\" ones\u2026\n3. Maybe you will benefit from using \"formal\" **textbook reading systems,** e.g. SQ3R or P2R from [this short reference PDF](http://lsc.cornell.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Textbook-Reading-Systems.pdf) by Cornell University. SQ3R is a pretty universal approach &amp; you can find it in reference materials on any big university' website it seems\u2026 And I recently saw a multi-gilded comment by a former college tutor somewhere on reddit that was recommending &amp; explaining, basically, a somewhat modified SQ3R approach.\n4. You can make it more fun to use the Pomodoro technique by tracking your stats in a paper notebook *(putting checkmarks/marking the item as completed on paper feels rewarding!),* and here is [a medical student's example](https://imgur.com/a/0YHJrXq) and his additional explanations are in his comment in BasicBulletJournals subreddit, BasicBulletJournals/comments/f8fdxf/medical_student_bullet_journal_with_heavy_use_of/fil01ld/\n5. Get enough nutrients from your food, especially vitamins B, vitamin C (is crucial for proper memory), iron (iron deficiency increases ADHD symptoms; vitamin C is needed for proper iron absorption; the more refined carbs you consume (sweets, bakery) the more vitamin C your body needs; iron absorption is really decreased if you make less than 1h break between your \"iron\" food and your intake of caffeinated stuff / herbal teas).
