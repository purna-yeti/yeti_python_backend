To be honest, the math that goes into most machine learning isn't super complex, but it's definitely not trivial and it's quite broad.\n\nSo, one can pick up a few textbooks or take some online courses or even just some blog posts to fill in these gaps, but you'll find that it can be difficult to follow the \"right\" path to reach the breadth of knowledge required to \"understand\" machine learning.  The devils in the details when it comes to that kind of stuff.  Basically, someone who spends their undergrad studying math is certainly going to spend time learning stuff that they may never see again or stuff that doesn't pertain to machine learning, but they will also certainly be more better equipped to understand the meaning behind the various formulations and equations that constitute machine learning as a field.\n\nWith that being said, one can definitely incrementally learn the math specific to ML if they are smart about it.  There are some general things that you'd need to know before hopping in (things like linear algebra, multivariate calculus, and probability theory), but once you're at the point of at least recognize most of the symbols and terminology, you can start reading through papers and textbooks while just looking up anything you're not familiar with.  This is essentially how it works for those \\_with\\_ a more formal background in mathematics, so you wouldn't be doing anything wrong here.\n\nAs far as learning resources, I'd start with some introductory courses in linear algebra, calculus, probability theory, and statistics.  I have taken the intro to stats course offered (for free) by Udacity and it's pretty good, but I'm sure any online course on these subjects would work fine.\n\nFrom there, you will be mostly equipped to actually start learning the math behind machine learning, which can be pretty open ended.  I honestly don't think it's worth going through a formal ML textbook and torturing oneself trying to understand every little piece of math, but you \\_should\\_ be able to at this point (keeping in mind that you'd most likely have to still continuously learn more math as you're learning ML).  Obviously a good resource is an online course in ML which doesn't skip the math portions, and there are a lot of them out there (Udacity's are probably descent, but [Andrew Ng's Coursera courses](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=andrew%20ng) are considered to be the best, albeit a little dated).\n\nAlternatively, if you find yourself particularly interested in a specific field or, better yet, a specific piece of research, diving into papers is an excellent way to test your skills and fill in the gaps.  For example, I'm focusing in Reinforcement Learning, and a key paper in the field is [Policy Gradient Methods by Sutton (et al)](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/1713-policy-gradient-methods-for-reinforcement-learning-with-function-approximation.pdf).  If you skim through it, you'll see that the math is relatively dense, but also not super complex.  Of course, this doesn't really touch on the theory of something like neural networks (which will have more linear algebra), but you get the idea.  If you can get to the point where you can pick up one of these key papers and work through and understand it completely, then you're math skills will be significantly superior to \\_many\\_ ML practitioners out there.  You'd be surprised how many CS PhD students would be simply unable to work through these kinds of papers.\n\nAnd that leads me to this last bit of info: experience in advanced mathematics is \\_not\\_ necessary to be a machine learning practitioner.  I'd certainly argue that the more one knows and is comfortable with math, the better they will be at understanding and implementing machine learning, but at the end of the day most of the math has already been done for you.  The fact that a student in middle school can feasibly go from nothing to a hand-written digit classifier in less than an hour with only a tutorial and a web browser highlights this.  This is why I wouldn't \"waste\" my time on the math behind ML without a good reason (e.g., research).  It's much more efficient to just learn the math as you need it and spend the majority of one's time implementing and experimenting.\n\nOf course, given how specific your question is, I'm guessing you're already aware of most of this.  If so, then I **definitely** encourage you to study the math behind it.  It's very rewarding and more useful than most people understand.  As far as getting a Masters, I'd say that it's really not that helpful depending on your goals.  If you go to graduate school to study AI, the expectation is that you can handle all the math and theory on your own.  And, again, the university setting is crucial in understanding the details of everything, but, frankly, I think it'd make more sense to first learn this stuff on your own.  Once you get to the point where you can read research papers, then consider a Master's.  At that point, you won't have to spend your time catching up with the math and theory and can instead focus on the subtle but important bits (and networking, which is probably the most important aspect of school anyways).\n\nSorry for the long-winded response, but I have been giving questions like these a lot of thought since I was studying math in undergrad.  I'm glad that I have the background and experience I do, but there are a lot of things I would have done differently had I been steered in the right direction.

I myself started learning ML a few years ago and now works at an AI startup working on ML engineering. A few suggestions for your reference to start with the learning process: \n\n 1.  Machine Learning is mostly based on statistic learning and math which used to build models for classifiers, and then to show why this model will succeed to predict with high probability. You would want to know the theory behind the algorithms and how they work, for example, probability and statistics, linear algebra and calculus. \n\n2. If you don\u2019t know any programming language, try to learn Python quickly. It is particularly helpful and important when *implementing* the algorithms without needing to deal with classes and code structure etc. It also helps to understand the internal mechanics of the so called \"Machine\".\n\n3. Leverage the free resources online: eg Andrew Ngs\u2019 ML course on [https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). I learned a lot from it.\n\n4. Depending on your career direction - if you want to be a data scientist, you defiantly have to do the #1 &amp; 2 above; but if you just want to leverage ML tool to do some analytics work, you can fully utilize online free courses like #3, as well as try the AutoML (automated machine learning) tools on the market, which basically automates the machine learning pipeline and make the process easier and faster to build the model for you and thus you save lots of time and energy focusing on using the model to do the analytics work.  It will give you a sense of what ML is and how each step works. I have used some AutoML tools like H2O.ai (www.h2o.ai), [R2.ai](https://R2.ai) (www.r2.ai), DataRobot (www.datarobot.com) etc. Some of them offer free trial which is pretty awesome. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope these are helpful and have fun with the learning!", "created_utc": 1558541048, "gildings": {}, "id": "eofqjnq", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_brlyb9", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_brlyb9", "permalink": "/r/MachineLearning/comments/brlyb9/i_try_to_learn_machine_learning_from_scratch_is/eofqjnq/", "retrieved_on": 1558541049, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MachineLearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r3gv", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1559248020, "created": 1558541048.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "UrsusArctosMajor", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_s1aol", "author_patreon_flair": false, "body": "I share Konundrum's issue I think, or something similar.\n\nI went through Khan Academy and filled in all of the blanks I never learned when I should have learned them. There's a matrix of tiny squares in KA that illustrates these holes; I made it my mission to fill the matrix in with \"mastered\" squares. They're always adding more content, so the matrix may never be \"complete\", but imho you should never stop pursuing a more complete understanding of anything.\n\nOther things that helped:\n\nI never gave up on the idea that no matter how old I get or how others yammer about old dogs and new tricks, I would master math. When I aced my first calc I exam I was elated. Let the naysayers stunt their own development. That's not me, to quote my favorite assassin-navigator.\n\nI gave myself permission to screw up.  You won't learn if you don't make mistakes. Don't let your ego get in the way: it's no way to live. If you're not making progress with a problem leave it to your subconscious and move on. By the time you come back to it, your brain's brain will probably have a solution.\n\nI practiced writing more slowly and legibly so that I could backtrack through my work and find my errors. I even switched to a softer lead so I could write more easily.\n\nFinally, sleep more than you think you need to sleep. You will remember more and feel more in control of |everything|.

[optional] take a course of some CS / SW topic that interests you (or read a book)\n5. repeat points [4, 5] until either someone notices you and offers you a job, you make a product / app / whatever that you can capitalise on, or someone hires you :)\n\n\n---\n\n(Source: I'm a AI researcher who has worked at several tech companies and startups, currently at Facebook.)", "created_utc": 1558465876, "gildings": {}, "id": "eocyg7p", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_brbran", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_eocbkt9", "permalink": "/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/brbran/olympic_athlete_looking_to_plan_for_the_short_and/eocyg7p/", "retrieved_on": 1558465887, "score": 10, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "UKPersonalFinance", "subreddit_id": "t5_2wkka", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1559223377, "created": 1558465876.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "Virtual_Limbo", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_u6b3euc", "author_patreon_flair": false, "body": "There are SOOOOO many online resources to learn coding if that's what you are asking, as far as networking goes I do not know how to do that other than MY idea of doing it.

There is valuable content on the internet, but the signal to noise ratio is horrible. Books are not better, but they are typically vetted by publishers, reviewed by peers and curated through reviews. I would also argue that most books have much more effort put into them. \n\nTo me the internet is fast food and books are fine dining. Both have their use-cases and serve a purpose. Not all fine dining restaurants are worth the price (your time) but some are transcendent. Equally some of the content on the internet is amazing, but finding it you will be wading through piles of shit (which also costs time). In addition, I would argue that content consumed on the internet tends to be done so in a partial state of concentration. You are much more likely to tab over to facebook, skim the article or simply just bookmark it for later and never read it. With a book one takes a concerted effort to focus on the topic at hand and (hopefully) take it in unencumbered by the mental load of the digital world. \n\nLastly, most books are formatted in way that is conducive to effective learning. Publishers and professional authors structure the content in such a way that you will retain what is read more readily, this is backed up by studies. The overview, content, application, summary layout allows your brain to cement abstract concepts. Books allow for both diffuse and focused learning modes of the brain.

I am sorry but there's no avoiding that. You need to know basics - what are matrices, how to calculate matrix inverse, derivatives/integrals and gradients. You are not getting anywhere without this level of knowledge. \n\n&gt; my end goal is to create a machine learning application that identifies objects but highly accurately with difficult subjects\n\nHow accurately? How many individual object classes? How much do they differ from each other? \n\nEg. it's not hard to build a system that will have near 100% accuracy if you are giving it images of squares vs rectangles vs triangles vs circles in high resolution and 0 optical artifacts. \n\nIt's hella harder if all you have is a low res image full of artifacts and are trying to discern between, say, dogs vs cats vs squirrels. Especially if you also don't have a proper training set and maaaany hours to train it on. \n\nPersonally I recommend this for starters:\n\nhttps://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning\n\nIt teaches the general theory behind machine learning and will make you implement many popular algorithms by hand. It doesn't use Python (you use Octave or Matlab) but frankly amount of coding is absolutely minimal, it's often like 3-4 lines of code per assignment (as it's literally matrix multiplications and additions). It also tries to teach basics of necessary math but I honestly don't think you will get far without going more in depth into this field sooner or later. Afterall the whole field of machine learning is quite literally applied math. \n\nAfterwards you can go a step further and explore the field of deep learning (as that's what you will most likely use if you need to identify objects on images/videos etc):\n\nhttps://www.deeplearning.ai/", "created_utc": 1557681002, "gildings": {}, "id": "en8fbg7", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_bnqnuw", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_bnqnuw", "permalink": "/r/learnprogramming/comments/bnqnuw/machine_learning_for_beginners_where_to_begin/en8fbg7/", "retrieved_on": 1557681003, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "learnprogramming", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r7yd", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1558534644, "created": 1557681002.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "viper233", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_59e52", "author_patreon_flair": false, "body": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn\n\n\nTake a look at this if you aren't a good learner or don't think you are as smart as most other people. _Learning_ is hard but knowing how to learn will help a lot.\n\n\nSounds like you've learnt some hard life lessons, journal that shit, it's your textbook for not screwing up the next time. All of us are 3-6 mistakes away from completely screwing everything up. Everyone messes up, you are not special, the best overcome it and move on, everyone has the ability to do this even though it may seem impossible.\n\n\nDon't pay for learning stuff if possible,(echoing u/SailTheWorldWithMe) even certifications and exams and stuff unless you are going to end up with a pay day at the end of it (to start with). Libraries are god damn gold mines!!! Why the hell would buy a book off amazon? While I agree with u/rbgnr111 , you don't have money to spend on that shit at the moment, get rid of a debt, that'll be a great win that you will have in your bag, then maybe start looking at certifications. Can't go wrong with programming or an AWS certification. IT might take you 10 years until you can work remote but it's possible and then you might be ready to really support a family.

If you are looking to get ahead in your finances, you need to invest in things that are going to make you money over the long term, you'll learn that in finance. You are young, your best investment is yourself (and paying down your debt) so that means learning to create more revenue from yourself over time. You've got a life of learning ahead of you, that's what a lot of us who didn't start off so well end up having to do and will also be necessary for IT roles.\n\n\nExercise and diet are equally paramount to investing in yourself. Good eating, exercise habits are fundamental at your age, learn about foods, what you are eating, hypertension. Studying and exercising are pointless without enough sleep. Good Habits are paramount to survival, bad habits will break you in the end. \n\n\nTry out a bunch of different courses, see if you kinda like some and then try to learn enough in one to make a career out of it.

I personally jumped right into [this course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/classical-composition) (which I can't recommend enough btw) when I could just barely read sheet music. It will be a rather steep learning curve, but on the other hand you will come out with a pretty decent understanding of music theory. If if feels impossible, you can always come back to it once you've gained some experience.\n\nListen to as many recordings (and live performances) of music as you can! Listen for all the details and nuances, try to guess at the composer's intentions, reverse engineer pieces as much as you can. This gives you an \"intuitive\" understanding of how music works. In fact, if you have a good enough ear, you can subconsciously understand most music theory concepts, even before you learn it formally! This happened to me to an extent, and music theory was a revelation.\n\nAs to how you sit down with a particular feeling and transform it onto the keys, the process depends a lot on the person, as everyone experiences music slightly differently. Your main aim here is to be fluent enough with the instrument so that you are able to play whatever you imagine in your head with minimal delay. Transcribing is one of the best things you can do to achieve this sort of fluency. Also, having an understanding of basic chord functions helps as a starting point.\n\nThere are also some music theory channels on Youtube, which have really helped with my composition/improvisation, such as Rick Beato and Adam Neely. \n\nKeep at it -- it's difficult, but it's a blast!", "created_utc": 1556801102, "gildings": {}, "id": "emb89h5", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_bjly2o", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_bjly2o", "permalink": "/r/composer/comments/bjly2o/selftaught_piano_playing_composing/emb89h5/", "retrieved_on": 1556801113, "score": 2, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "composer", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sjib", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1556901669, "created": 1556801102.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "ichmagkartoffel", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3h1y753l", "author_patreon_flair": false, "body": "Hi there!\n\nI was in the exact same position as you currently are a couple of months ago, here is what I did that helped me a lot:\n\n1.
