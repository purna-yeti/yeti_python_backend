These people paid large amounts of money to cheat the admissions process of well-known colleges, faking test scores, athletic credentials, and other records. The purpose of these bribes? to make sure their children made it into colleges such as Stanford and Yale.\n\nThis scandal has sparked many conversations on social media, the general reactions stemming from horrified and angry to shocked and hurt.\n\nBut the most astounding part was the fact that the majority of society seemed surprised. \u201cHow could this be allowed to happen?\u201d was the general tone that echoed over social media and the the news.\n\nWhat else could you expect from a system that has been touted for years as THE WAY to success?\n\nHeres what you\u2019ll notice about any system (like college) that is held up as the perfect path:\n\n1. Everyone\u2019s going to flock to it. \u201cCollege = success,\u201d kids are told from day 1. They want to be successful, so college is the next logical step. Soon the entire society is marked by blind faith in the system, and when the first winds of scandal cross the horizon, that same society is left crushed.\n\n2. Someone\u2019s going to try to take advantage of it. There will always be those individuals that bribe to trick a system or gain favors with it. History is marked by these people- some things never change. This also comes from blind faith in the system- some will do anything in their power to acquire the status that the system offers.\n\n3. When given a choice, it will always lean in favor of the money that supports it. Money is the only way for the system to survive. That\u2019s why, in addition to the college scandal that\u2019s alive and well, many people are drawing attention to legacy status as another factor of inconsistency that lies at college\u2019s core.\n\nWhat have we established so far? The system is corrupt by nature. The college admissions scandal was only the catalyst that opened people\u2019s eyes to the corruption.\n\n**So what are our options?**\n\nWe could take the stance of many people, and complain about how the rich are always going to have advantages like this. We could gripe about how lower-class students are never going to have a chance, and cry for the government or some other third party to fix this mess.\n\nBut that\u2019s a victim mindset. You might get some engagement on Twitter about your martyrly rant, but you won\u2019t be any more free. You might rally a whole bunch of people around your cause, but you\u2019ll still be chained to the actions of the people who \u201cwronged you\u201d by ultimately exposing the system you put your faith in.\n\nInstead, let\u2019s take this scandal from the perspective that we\u2019re all free individuals that have full control over our own futures, regardless of the actions of others.\n\nThis means viewing college just like any other life investment.\n\n**College as an Investment- is it worth it?**\n\nSo let\u2019s look at college from the perspective of an investment. Yes, it\u2019s an investment, whether you\u2019re a parent or a college-age student.\n\nOther than the obvious investment of money, many parents spend time, energy, and money getting their kids into just the right sports so they can (hopefully!) have a chance at good scholarships. Outside that, some pay for tutors and test prep- this side of the investment increases the more money you have. Then there\u2019s the stress spent as they wonder if their teens are ever going to get it figured out and the countless fights over whether to complete homework or not.\n\nNot all of this is bad. Children are a great investment! But when you start to examine the investment closely, you\u2019ll see that more often than not, 12 years of time (at least) + thousands of dollars + lots of stress are spent investing not in your children, but in college. It\u2019s often not really about the child\u2019s goals and passions. It\u2019s about \u201cwhat\u2019s best\u201d for the child.\n\nAnd we\u2019re seeing now that what people have told us is \u201cbest\u201d for the child might actually be one of the worse investments you can make.\n\nBut let\u2019s look at it from the child\u2019s perspective.\n\nTo start out, as young adults your children spend 4 of the best years of their lives in college. That\u2019s no small investment. Considering that technology is advancing at lightning speed, the value you lose by not being actively in the market is also a huge cost.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s normally the child that is stuck with student loan debt 10 years down the road. More times than not, they have a job outside their degree specification. If they\u2019re lucky, they have a job that\u2019s making them enough money to live comfortably and pay off the remainder of the debt.\n\nCompare this to a real estate or stock market venture.\n\nWould you invest in a company that has a track record of inconsistencies and no guarantee for future value? Would you buy a house crumbling at its very foundation? What about making an investment that you know your child will have to be paying off 10 years down the road?\n\nWouldn\u2019t you do your research to find the other opportunities available, even if everyone around you stated that it\u2019s still the safest route?\n\nOptions that YOU, as a free individual, have today (no matter your income level, race, GPA, or other irrelevant factors)\n\nWe\u2019re entering an era where education, in addition to many other social and economic structures, is becoming decentralized.\n\nThat means you don\u2019t have to answer to a third party like college to have a successful career.\n\n(I know someone\u2019s going to ask this, so let\u2019s get it out of the way:)\n\n*\u201cBut what if I want to be a doctor or a lawyer? I need a degree to practice.\u201d*\n\nSure, these are examples of careers that aren\u2019t in that decentralized category. But good news for you: when others are making the free choice to build careers in more profitable ways, the value of your degree will go up. Besides, lawyers make up 0.36% of U.S. population, and doctors make up only 0.29%. That still leaves 99.35% of the population to explore careers in new ways.\n\nIn the end, college is only necessary for highly specific careers, and even if you\u2019re sure you want one of those highly specific careers, it\u2019s wise to take some time researching before rushing into the investment.\n\nSo you have all the information, here are some opportunities you can pursue outside college:\n\n1. Take a gap year before making a final decision.\n\nA gap year can be the perfect way to explore a possible career path without having to commit years of your life and thousands of dollars to it.\n\nEven if you\u2019re sure you want a specific career, it\u2019s still good to take a year and explore your options. If, in one year, you\u2019ve already changed your mind about your preferred career path, then it\u2019s a pretty good sign that you would have burned out in college as well.\n\nPlan your gap year around things you\u2019re interested in. If you\u2019re thinking of law, volunteer for an attorney. Find masters of your preferred career and learn from them. Take some courses related to your interests. Regardless if you decide to go to college after this year, you\u2019ll have experience under your belt that will be valuable to your career later!\n\n2. Skip college and start a business.\n\nIt\u2019s the perfect era for entrepreneurship. Never has it been easier to reach people, build relationships, and sell new products! Many young people I know have at least started Etsy shops or dropshipping sites, and the experience is invaluable to their growth.\n\nEntrepreneurship is also the perfect way to learn a large array of skills that you can take anywhere in life. Start a business, and you\u2019ll launch a foundational career path in sales, marketing, customer service, operations, and basic tech.\n\nOh, and in case you needed more convincing, here\u2019s a list of entrepreneurs from the last 100 years that succeeded without degrees:\n\nMark Zuckerberg\n\nSteve Jobs\n\nAndrew Carnegie\n\nCoco Chanel\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright\n\nMichael Dell\n\nSteve Madden\n\nYou\u2019re welcome.\n\n3. Invest in an apprenticeship.\n\nApprenticeships are the way to go in today\u2019s world. Not only are traditional trade apprenticeships a highly valuable experience for any young person, but more and more tech apprenticeships become available every day as well. Here are some apprenticeship/ job placement programs that are available today:\n\n[Praxis:](https://discoverpraxis.com/) 1-year bootcamp + paid apprenticeship\n\n[Crash:](https://crash.co/) discover, build, launch: start your career using these three steps\n\n[GenM:](https://genm.co/)free marketing courses and digital apprenticeships\n\n[GetApprenticeship](https://getapprenticeship.com/): entry level remote jobs\n\n4. Build your own higher education plan.\n\nIf you\u2019re serious about learning, then take the time to craft your own learning plan. You can work on the side, and complete the courses you want to finish for a much lower cost than you would pay in college.\n\nI personally know several developers who are entirely self-taught. Many other highly-needed skills like copywriting, graphic design, and video editing can be learned online. With a little discipline and a lot of showing your work, building a career simply by taking courses online is much easier than you think.\n\nDon\u2019t know where to get started? Check out these websites:\n\n[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/)\n\n[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)\n\n[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)\n\n[ALISON](https://alison.com/)\n\n5. Just start working.\n\nI can\u2019t stress this one enough. Especially if you\u2019re not sure what you want your career to be, the best investment is to just start working and saving money.\n\nHaving experience at a mediocre job is much better than having no experience at all! And there\u2019s nothing stopping you from building a small business on the side, or taking courses you\u2019re interested in while you\u2019re working.\n\nJobs in serving and fast food are one of the best ways to build customer service skills. (If you\u2019re great at customer service, you\u2019ll be in high demand, because every business wants their customers to be happy.) Using tools like the value creation mindset will set you up for success no matter how irrelevant you think your job might be.\n\n**In conclusion**\n\nThe college scandal is nothing to fear. It\u2019s simply the manifestation of a system that society has relied on too strongly for the last couple decades. With the numerous options available today, it\u2019s never been easier for young people to break the mold and strike out on unique paths that are meaningful to them.\n\nDon\u2019t let a scandal hold you back. It\u2019s time for career launch!\n\nOriginally published [here](https://discoverpraxis.com/college-admission-scandal-how-to-respond/) on the Praxis blog.
