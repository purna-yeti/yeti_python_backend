Which arguably is more useful for AI than pure computer science for AI. As this field is **literally** applied math, code is just there to avoid doing billions of calculations yourself. The main benefit of PhD and why it's recommended is twofold:\n\n* first, this is when you actually learn how to read and write scientific papers. \n* second, it does extend more abstract and theoretical classes.

This is a bit technical as it gets into argumentation, reasoning, and debates. More broadly, argumentation is about persuasion, which includes writing scientific articles. You'd have to be interested in arguments to get through this. Learning here would be learning by transferring valuable concepts, not directly made for academics.\n\nMore on the methods side, I'd say these two Coursera courses by Daniel Lakens are **maximally** relevant, even if you just watch the videos (as I did): [Improving Your Statistical Inferences](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inferences?) and [Improving Your Statistical Questions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/improving-statistical-questions).

That is an entirely different category than simply learning the Java language, so may have misinterpreted your intentions here. You can do it, it sounds like you just need to regain your confidence. There is nothing a UNC-Charlotte bootcamp can offer you, instruction wise, that the best online Android course couldn't. There are structured courses as well that mimic bootcamp. The reality is, regardless of having the structure of the class or not, there will be times where you will have to work by yourself to reinforce your own learning, do homework, assignments, etc. Fast forward to the day you are employed with a job programming services in Java, you most certainly will need that skill. \n\nThe most important skills in my opinion for being a developer of any language (Java, C#, C++, Go, JavaScript, etc) is learning how to learn.

There is so much more to learn about the structure, interaction, functionality, utility, psychology, etc. of design and development. And there are real prices to pay for not knowing things with regard to semantic markup, SERP, SEM, accessibility, responsive, SSL, etc. And that's only the technical aspect of the role. There's also client relationships, billing, accounting, marketing, amongst other aspects of the business. And then the ability to \"ask the right questions\" and \"see the red flags\". So many projects start well and take a sudden turn for the worse because of assumptions and unaddressed expectations. Assumptions and expectations that would not have been left \"open to interpretation\" if the right questions were asked in the requirements gathering and discovery phases.
