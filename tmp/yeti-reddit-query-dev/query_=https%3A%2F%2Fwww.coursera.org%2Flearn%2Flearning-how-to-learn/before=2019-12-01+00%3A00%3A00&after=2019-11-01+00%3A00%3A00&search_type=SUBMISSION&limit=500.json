It contains things I wish I knew before I began the program.\n\n\n## The Pros: What you can expect from the GT OMSA Program\n\n\n- **Name Recognition:** Georgia Tech is a name that carries high prestige in multiple fields including: finance, technology, engineering. If you complete the program, it will somewhat improve your resume.\n\n\n- **edX Platform:** Most of the content will be on edX, so it is easy to access.\n\n\n-**Efficiency:** If you already know the materiel before you start, you can efficiently complete the program. I would recommend this program for people that have *significant* experience programming in multiple languages, performing large scale data analysis, and are *highly* familiar with data cleaning and processing techniques. If you have already working in a data science role for a few years, and have worked with python and R regularly in a professional capacity, you can probably complete this program efficiently.\n\n\n\n## The Cons: What you can also expect from the GT OMSA Program\n\n\nThe Georgia Tech online program is not in the business of teaching. What I mean by that is this: you are going to be responsible for learning the materiel on your own, mostly through other sources such as separate edX or Coursera classes, Amazon book purchases, or Google searches. The lessons are few and very short, and do not cover the tested topics directly. If you do not already know how to do something, it is highly unlikely you will learn it during the program.\n\n\nAs an example, these are the recent midterm scores from a CSE-6040 midterm:\n\n\nGrade | % of Students\n:-: | :-:\nA | 57%\nB | 5%\nC | 10%\nD | 8%\nF | 20%\n\n\nAn Expected Distribution\n\nGrade | % of Students\n:-: | :-:\nA | 20%\nB | 40%\nC | 20%\nD | 15%\nF | 5%\n\n\n\nThese are the students that have completed the exam a couple days before it was due. Notice the bi-modal distribution in the GT class. Normally, you'd expect grades to be normally distributed around the B to B+ area. This would be indicative of a normal program, for which students were taught material and some naturally performed better than others. Here we have a large chunk of students with A's, and another large group failing. Keep in mind that these are smart and motivated people; this is a difficult program to get in to. In addition, they had 36 hours and full access to internet resources and all class materiel (including videos). My speculative explanation for this is the first group (the A's) came into the program already having substantial experience with the material, while the latter group was hoping to learn that material from the classes and instructors.\n\n\nIn this subreddit, I often hear people say \"this program is hard and isn't for everyone\". However, it is my experience that what makes this program hard is more a lack of effort by GT than anything else. In a given week, there are about 10-15 minutes of lesson videos, and then your homework assignment. For those assignments, most people spend 2-4 hours per week working. Ultimately, the assignments can be completed with a few lines of code. And if you are well trained, could be completed in 30-45 minutes. The substantial amount of time people spend on projects is not working, but rather educating themselves. I can't recommend a program where you spend 2 hours Googling stuff for every 10 minutes of class.\n\nFor comparison, I'm currently also in another MS program (online) at a BIG10 university and the instruction quality is night and day different. We have 60-75 minutes of online class lectures (recordings) per week. Our projects are usually building models that I can immediately apply outside of class.\n\n## In Summary\nTL;DR : If you already know the material that is going to be taught and have *significant* experience working as a technical data analyst or data scientist, this program will add prestige to your resume. Think of it more as a *certification*.\n\nIf you do not have 3-5 years of programming experience (specializing in Python, R, Algorithm Design, and working with large data sets), you are not going to succeed in this program. You are not going to be *taught* these things. It is also unlikely you will pass the classes. If your goal is to learn a new skill set, you are much better off in another online program.
