Make Your Fundamentals Clear:\n\nA common mistake that a student or beginner commit while learning programming is skipping the fundamentals or chapter 1 and directly jumping to the next chapter right away. To understand the advanced concepts of programming you need to be very clear about the fundamentals of programming. If you will be doing the same mistake then at some point, you will end up with lots of confusions and you will have to come back to your basics again. These fundamentals are Data Structures, variables, control structures, syntax, tools or text editors. When you start doing programming pick one programming language, stick with it and clear all the basics of programming first before going to the next level. Your overall time to learn coding will be definitely saved if you will follow this path.\n\n \n\n### 2. Learn By Doing, Practicing and Not Just Reading:\n\nA common mistake beginners do while learning programming is just reading a book or looking at the sample code on their desktop without practicing it. It\u2019s easy to read about the loops, variables and getting all the things in your head but actual programming doesn\u2019t work in this way. You really need to get your hands dirty in coding and keep practicing it regularly. When you start programming you face a lot of problems, you get stuck there, you will be asked to implement the code practically and find the solution for a specific problem and there you will scratch your head while implementing the code. When you write the code, play with the code, change your code to see different results, optimize the code and try different solutions, your logical thinking ability get improves day by day and you eventually learn a lot of things which make you a better programmer. When you start coding, practice the same code or sample again and again until or unless you don\u2019t need to refer to the same book or resource from where you have learned. Also build your own project, participate in coding challenges, play coding related games, practice it at your own end every single day.\n\n### 3. Code By Hand:\n\nWhen you start programming as a beginner you will be thinking that why should I code by hand. It\u2019s a time-consuming process, I can\u2019t run and check my code on paper and also if I actually need to implement something on my system then why should I use pen and paper. One of the biggest reasons is the ***interviews***. When you will apply for the jobs in programming, most of the time the technical evaluation process will include code by hand. You will be asked to write code using pen and paper or you might have to use a whiteboard. Coding by hand is something old school technique but it actually involves a test for a programmer\u2019s proficiency. Coding by hand can give you a clear understanding of syntax and algorithms, you make a deeper connection in your brain. Learning programming this way will make your work easier and faster later.\n\n### 4. Share, Teach, Discuss and Ask For Help:\n\nOne of the best ways to understand programming easily and quickly is by teaching. Teaching to someone, sharing your knowledge, doing discussions with other programmers will make you a better programmer quickly. Teaching to someone is teaching to yourself too, so if you are able to teach to somebody that means you truly understand the concepts. It is the best habit to learn something in-depth and you will realize that you don\u2019t need to come back on the same topic.  \nYou can also participate in open source projects, discuss your code with your co-programmers or contribute on [Github](https://github.com/), also you can take help from forum or discussion site. When you learn programming do not hesitate in asking for help. Beginners do this mistake and feel shy when they need to ask for help. It doesn\u2019t matter if you ask silly questions and look stupid, it will help you in the long run and if you don\u2019t do it you will be struggling in coding later. So it\u2019s good to find a mentor or take help from fellow programmers to understand concepts easily and quickly. Your mentor or professional can guide you better because they have been already in your shoes before.\n\n \n\n### 5. Use Online Resources:\n\nThere are plenty of online resources available paid or unpaid. You can take help from these online resources and start your programming journey. You can subscribe to youtube channels or try coding boot camps to learn programming quickly and effectively.  [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and plenty of resources available for guidance and to learn programming. Also make a habit of reading programming related blogs, and taking help from [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), Reddit\u2019s \u201cprogramming languages\u201d subreddit like site or online community.\n\n \n\n### 6. Take Breaks:\n\nIf you want to learn programming it\u2019s not good to sit in front of a computer for hours and hours and try to grasp everything in one go. You will be exhaust by doing this so it\u2019s better to learn coding in chunks. Take some short breaks to get refreshed. You should also keep this thing in mind while debugging your code. Sometimes you spend hours and hours to find the bug but you don\u2019t get the solution for your code so it\u2019s good to take a short break, clear your mind and do something else. It will restore your focus and you may come up with the solution for your code where you were stuck. Also, try to eliminate all kinds of distractions. Turn off your phone notification, email notifications and try to isolate yourself to be focused. Doing this you will save your lot of time and will stay away from headache or frustration.\n\n### 7. Learn to Use Debugger:\n\nMaking mistakes in coding is very common and it\u2019s completely acceptable in programming. You will find a lot of errors in your code at the beginning so it\u2019s good to use debuggers to find out errors, impacts on your result and check where you have made the mistake. You will save a lot of time using a debugger or a tool to fix the errors in your code. If you are good at debugging, it will be easier to learn programming. So learn to use some good debugging technique or use tools to check your piece of code.\n\nIn the end, the last tip is not to quit when you start your journey in programming. You might be thinking in the middle that you are not smart enough to code but keep in mind that in order to think like a coder it takes some time and patience but to learn it quickly, you just need to follow the right path and be consistent. Follow everything step-by-step, make your fundamentals clear first, keep practicing it and once you are done with basics take the challenges and participate in competitive programming on different sites to get better on it, to build your logical ability and to think like a coder. You will find yourself later how good coder you have become by practicing it each and every single day.\n\n**Good Luck and Happy Coding!!!**", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied":

is probably a course on udemy forum courses are created by experts and professionals in their field who remain active in those fields the instructors on udemy are encouraged to update their courses regularly to ensure that they do remain relevant you as a student are also important by udemy to rate the courses that on a five-star rating so that other student scan find out whether the courses are actually worth doing most courses will give you one or two preview videos and a full syllabus so you can actually checkout what you\u2019re gonna learn and the style of teaching each instructor gives you before actually purchasing a course so you can find out if that course is actually right for you so what do you get on completion of a udemy course well you do receive a certificate from you to be via email but these are not accredited certificates so it\u2019s really just for your own personal use or you hang out on your wall and feel pretty good the main thing here is that you

paper course model so on a normal day course scan actually range between 75 and 300 US dollars however there is a silver lining there\u2019s good point that you to me loves to throw out a sale they will have a sale for pretty much every occasion so at least once a month your fun course is reduced from 300 dollars down to maybe $ 12.99 or 20 bucks or something so That\u2019s why for me it is a

I started watching some online video lectures, for example \\[this online course\\]( [https://www.coursera.org/learn/iot-architecture](https://www.coursera.org/learn/iot-architecture)) which surprisingly gave a lot of practical advice.\n\nSo far I'm actually having a lot of fun learning about all of this stuff, but I'm only getting more and more questions. Here's something that I've been trying to get a better understand of recently and I haven't been able to find many good resources on. I'm posting here in hopes that someone could shed some light and that those answers might also be of interest to others.\n\n* Are there certain manufacturers/architectures that are clearly dominating certain industries? (e.g. the SoC used on the Raspberry Pi)\n* Say I'm designing the following devices. Is this something that would normally run embedded Linux? Or something else like the ESP32? What type of processor/architecture/software is most common for this type of task?\n* IoT smart plug/bulb/etc\n* An appliance like a fridge with a nice touchscreen?\n* Prototype for a robotics company for a compute platform which has custom hardware requirements (e.g. form factor, harsh environment, etc) that require a custom board but otherwise something like a raspberry pi would be suitable for? Is it normal to just take the components of a single board computer like this and put them on your own device? Any issues with sourcing components when doing that? Are some SBC's preferred over others for these tasks regarding toolchain, etc?\n* Anything regarding some level of safety? For example, vehicle controller for an electric vehicle startup. I'm assuming this is actually something that would be offboard like a safety-rated MCU running without an OS, but for the sake of curiosity, in what instances could it make sense to have the safety function running on a safety-rated embedded OS (Linux or not)?\n\nThanks!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "embedded", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qins",

But I dunno, that's sort of the fun of learning new stuff, innit? \n\nWhitman and Dickinson aren't really \"modern\" in the sense they're more than a hundred years old, but they do both break from formal traditions that came before. Dickinson writes mostly in ballad meter but comes up with lots of ways to screw around with it. Whitman blows past metrical forms and writes in his own kind of free verse. \n\nSome possible discussion starters:\n\n***Baseline questions:***   \n* Do you like this poetry? How does it make you feel, how are you reacting? What are your favorite lines? Imagine it was written today, and the poets are friends of yours who have given it to you for your reaction -- what would you say to them?  \n* Pick one of the poems (or a section of the giant poem, in Whitman's case) What do you think is literally happening? What is the 'plot' or the argument, or what is being described?   \n\n***Dickinson:***  \n* What are the tools that Dickinson uses to express her ideas? How do these tools -- the verse, the caesuras (--) the weird capitalized nouns, etc -- change the meaning of what she's saying?\n* Do you agree with Dickinson in \"Tell all the Truth but tell it slant\"? Should we tell the truth indirectly? Does she actually think that herself?  \n* What about in \"The Brain, within its Groove\" -- what do you make of the way the metaphor gets abandoned so early in the poem? What's the image of thought Dickinson describes?    \n* In \"I dwell in Possibility,\" she compares 'Possibility' to 'Prose'. What are the dis/advantages of poetry over prose, how does each mode of writing approach their subjects? What does it mean to talk about these differences in a poem?  \n \n\n***Whitman:***  \n* What's the purpose of these long overfull lines? How do they help Whitman communicate?  \n* This poetry is very much about the outside world, the city, the activities of others. It's 'democratic writing' in the sense that Whitman includes all of these details about everyone and everything happening around him. What does this frenetic cataloguing do to you as a reader? How does it make you feel? What makes it different from, say, journalism?    \n* He starts out announcing there's a relationship between reader and poet in the first two lines -- \" I celebrate myself, and sing myself,/And what I assume you shall assume.\" How does the relationship between narrator and reader affect your reading?  \n* What's a barbaric yawp? (or rather, what does it mean to sound one's barbaric yawp)   \n\n***Comparing the two:***  \n* When we're talking about 'Intensive' vs 'Extensive' styles of poetry, what are the hallmarks of those styles? Extro- vs Introverted? How do the content of these poems relate to the form, and vice-versa?  \n* What do you make of Dickinson's kind of elitist slant versus Whitman's more democratic slant?

The course takes its students from roughly the turn of the century through the modern day, and it includes taped discussions with a smart bunch of cookies and links to resources. I've found the discussions to be really helpful when reading these poems. If you'd rather not sign up for the course, or if you'd rather dip in and out as your time permits, you can still participate in the discussion here on reddit/Discord.

Here are some examples:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) Try to learn new skills. \n\nHonestly, u gonna binge watch that Anime or drama. If u get bored why don't binge watch some online courses. One website that I like is Coursera. Why? It's very cheap. Cheaper than Nasi Katok. Yes, it cost 0 dollars. Provided that you finish it in one week or 7 days atau 7 hari. Yes, you will not get certified. But the important part is learning the necessary skills for urself. (Yes I know it selfish but remember this quote by someone famous:\" The best way to help people is to help urself first \". Once u finish, don't stop there. Create your own  personal project. This will get u hire.

Nda pyh lagi fokus decorating rumah.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3)LOSE WEIGHT. To lose weight, u just need limit ur intake and time and u do not have to go the gym ( Comment section ik u gonna debate on this and I will enjoy reading it with my fibre shake). And this is a good time to try to lose weight as we cannot dine out. So practice this and hopefully u lose weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo basically I want u to improve urself and u might have doubts.

learning](https://www.expertsystem.com/machine-learning-definition/) (ML) is a branch of computer science that provides the capability to the computers to learn without the requirement of any clearly formulated programming.\n\nMachine Learning offers great [career opportunities](https://www.tapresume.co.in/machine-learning-jobs) and is increasingly being used in almost all aspects of our knowledge domain \u2013 be it business, science, technology or even medicine and space research.\n\nIn order to start a [career](https://www.tapresume.co.in/) in machine learning, you need to have the passion to learn new things, as learning and the ability to solve problems on a day to day basis is the success mantra of this field. Before you set the foot in this segment, it is imperative to have a basic understanding of what machine learning is all about including the mathematical logic, alternative technologies used and hands-on-experience required.\n\nThis article is dedicated to all those professionals and students, who want to explore a career option in machine learning.\n\n**1. Be a Constant Learner**\n\nMachine learning in recent years has evolved rapidly with the adoption of new technologies, frameworks, business models and techniques. So, at the preliminary stage, you need to get curious about all these aspects and be a constant learner.\n\n**2. Develop a Logical Blend of Mind**\n\nMachine learning is a logical field and is best suited for aspirants who have a logical blend of mind. It integrates several disciplines such as mathematics, technology, and business analysis, making it an interdisciplinary job. Apart from a strong technological focus, you also need to need to be open to understand the business problems and possess the ability to interpret those problems into a machine learning paradigms, thereby adding value to the product or the project that you work upon.\n\n**3. Integrate with the Team you Work**\n\n[Machine learning](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/) is more about working as part of a team, rather than being an isolated fragment in the big organizational picture. One of the success stories of being an excellent machine learning expert is to be proactive to work in a team, assimilate their ideas and put your thoughts into action. So, it\u2019s necessary that you be a good team player.\n\n**4. Gain a Good Grounding in Data Analysis**\n\nData is the new oil for any industry or technological segment. Hence, [data analysts](https://www.tapresume.co.in/analysts-jobs) are the most suited professionals to make a perfect transition into a machine learning career as their next best career move. Of course, if you are not a data analyst, you need not worry; develop an analytical mindset and set your focus on data analysis and interpretation. This means you need to play with the data \u2013 dig the data, comprehend where it is most suited and infer the net outcomes from the data. Bottom line is you need to share the information in a prudent way, generate good visualization, and integrate information that can be easily understood by all stakeholders.\n\n**5. Learn the Right Programming Language to Get Started**\n\nThe best programming language that is most suited for machine learning is [Python](https://www.tapresume.co.in/python-jobs). Apart from that, you also need to learn how to use machine learning libraries. If you feel daunted about how to get started, there are a host of institutes and courses online that teaches you the concepts of Python, apart from customized courses dedicated only for machine learning. It\u2019s always better to connect with the experts to get going in this area.\n\n**6. Online Courses can Help you a Great Extent**\n\nAs mentioned in my earlier tip, you can take up some online courses, apart from participating in learning competitions (kaggle.com is one such website) to gain good knowledge and showcase it to others. There are several online customized courses offered by learning platforms such as [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), which are dedicated only for machine learning. Hence, enroll in some good online course, read new articles on emerging technologies and connect with technology experts on various social media platforms to trigger a career push in machine learning.\n\n**7. Research about the Industry where you want to Work**\n\nYou need to understand that every organization has specific and unique goals. Hence, it is better to do thorough research about the industry, where you want to work. For instance, it may take a couple of months to understand a financial product of a specific business segment, but the crux is to research and learn about it as quickly as possible to leverage your knowledge in this domain. Also, remember that you need not be an expert, but gaining some preliminary knowledge about the domain or the product that you are going to work really goes a long way in building a good career in machine learning.\n\n**8. Look for Small Companies**\n\nIf you are interested to begin your career in machine learning, it\u2019s always advisable to start small. Hence, don\u2019t target big companies such as Amazon, Google, etc as they look for experienced candidates. Try to target startup companies, where you have immense opportunities to learn and apply your knowledge.\n\n**9. Showcase Some toy Projects**\n\nOne aspect which helps a potential employer to take note of your skill sets is to showcase some good projects. Take the advice of your seniors; connect with experts and try creating and uploading a project in Github. This way, you could definitely gain an edge over other potential candidates, eying a career in machine learning.\n\n**Piece of Advice**\n\nSimilar to any other career option, you need to have the passion, interest to try new things and above all the genuine aptitude of learning to make a mark in machine learning. Keeping aside the technical and analytical skills, you need to get motivated about solving new challenges, day in and day out and always proactive to learn new technologies to keep yourself updated.
