I started with [Interneting is Hard](https://www.internetingishard.com/) which I found on this subreddit. I also did a set of free online classes through [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/web-design#courses). I started this hobby with the intention of making interactive data visualizations similar to what The Pudding team and the NYT Graphics team were producing. It is a weird field of data journalism that I think will only be expanding in the years to come. Through researching this type of work I found [Observable](https://observablehq.com/explore). Which has to be the coolest website ever for people who are interested in Data Visualization in Javascript. I learned Vega-Lite with this [tutorial](https://observablehq.com/@uwdata/introduction-to-vega-lite) (which was extremely easy to learn), and I am almost through learning D3 with this [tutorial](https://observablehq.com/@thetylerwolf/25-days-of-d3) (which is way more complex). Overall, I would say I am adequate now at making typical interactive graphs. But I still feel that if I knew more Javascript (as it relates both to managing, transforming data, and theory/syntax in general) I could be doing a lot better. \n\nI am open to any and all methods of learning. I have been looking for an online class or workshop specifically dedicated to working with data in JS and D3. I think that my employer would pay for it, if it is reasonably priced. I bought this [book](https://www.amazon.com/Interactive-Data-Visualization-Web-Introduction/dp/1491921285/ref=pd_lpo_14_img_0/137-5236687-0884544?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=1491921285&amp;pd_rd_r=e3216a30-9a49-4a95-9328-aa5bf84303bd&amp;pd_rd_w=OZpI7&amp;pd_rd_wg=vGubi&amp;pf_rd_p=7b36d496-f366-4631-94d3-61b87b52511b&amp;pf_rd_r=JTWHA25E67WN9CGD0C7E&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=JTWHA25E67WN9CGD0C7E) for D3 which has been helpful to review. But I still feel that I need to work on projects and have someone to ask questions when I hit road blocks (which is one of the problems when teaching yourself). I have asked questions on Stack Overflow, but sometimes I feel they are more theoretical or overview questions about how Javascript or D3 works. \n\nAnyways I am writing this post for suggestions on where to look for classes or workshops that may help me get better at tackling my own projects.

Due to the Coronavirus, all our social interactions have been reduced. This lead to closing Universities and getting all the students learning from home. Then teaching moved online.\n\nYou can teach almost any subject online, however, some subjects are going to be more productive online than others. For instance, you can teach online to medical students about all the illnesses of lungs. However, there is a part in that teaching that is about the interaction with actually ill people. That is very difficult to provide through an online teaching.\n\nIn robotics, something similar happens. If you want to teach robotics properly, you need to use a real robot. So how can we teach robotics online and provide a full learning experience?\n\nHow far can we go with online teaching of robotics?\n\nBefore answering this question, we need to identify what do we need to teach when teaching robotics, and then see what can be covered online.\n\nLet\u2019s have a look at the typical curriculum on robotics of some important Universities:\n\n* [Introduction to Robotics](https://www.cs.stanford.edu/groups/manips/teaching/cs223a/), Stanford University, fall 2020 program\n* [Introduction to robotics](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~16311/current/), Carnegie Mellon University, 2020 spring program\n* [Introduction to robotics](https://uclouvain.be/en-cours-2019-LMECA2732), University of Louvain-la-Neuve, 2020 spring program\n* [Modern Robotics](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/modernrobotics), Coursera Specialization path\n\nSummarizing from the syllabus of those courses, we conclude that the following are the main subjects when teaching robotics:\n\n* Robot action and perception\n* Arm Kinematics\n* Mobile robots kinematics\n* Robot dynamics\n* Motion planning and control\n* Robot Navigation\n* Computer Vision\n\nSo what we can see here is that when we are talking about teaching robotics, we are not talking about teaching how to build a robot (that would be more related to mechatronics and electronics), but about how to understand how robots work, specially in their interaction with the world, and how to create programs that make the robots properly interact with the world. We take, hence, the physical robot for granted and concentrate on the control algorithms.\n\nProviding robotics theory to remote students\n\nThat is the easy part of the teaching. If your online teaching is based only on slides describing the theory of the subjects above, then you are almost done. You just need to prepare your slides with the subject, and then use an online meeting tool to meet your students online (Zoom, Google Meet, Skype or any other meeting software). I\u2019m sure you know already which one to use.\n\nHow to provide some robotics practice\n\nIf you want your students to really understand the theoretical concepts, why they are required and what are their results in real life, you will need to provide some kind of practice.\n\nWhich kind of practice\n\nI propose to\u00a0teach ROS at the same time that we teach robotics, and use the former along the whole robotics semester as a tool to build an implement the robotics subject we are teaching. The idea is that we\u00a0use ROS to allow the student to actually practice what he is learning. For instance, if we are talking about the different algorithms of obstacle avoidance, we can provide a simulated robot and make the student create a ROS program that actually implements the algorithm for that robot. By following this approach, the learning of the student is not only theoretical but instead includes the practice of what is being told.\n\nTeaching ROS alongside the robotics teaching has also the benefit of what the students learn will be extremely beneficial for their careers, because ROS is becoming the standard in robotics worldwide.\n\nIf you like this approach, then you will have to provide your students an environment for practicing with ROS. Now that they are online and not at your labs, you will have to rely on the students computers for that.\n\nHow to provide a practice environment to remote robotics students\n\nYou have two options here:\n\n* Provide a robot simulations based environment\n* Provide a real robot based environment\n\nSimulation based environment for students\n\nThe goal is to set in the students computer a ROS based simulation environment ready for practising. That is not an easy task, specially when the students are remote. Here you have four ways to do it.\n\n1. Students install ROS in their computer.\u00a0Students will need to [follow the instructions here](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation). Risky option if your students do not have already Linux in their computers (because that implies having to install Linux first and do a dual boot in their computers).\n2. Students install a provided Virtual Machine with ROS. This option skips the step of installing Linux and dual boot. Still, students will need to install the VM software and the actual VM image containing Linux and ROS. I haven\u2019t found any VM ready to download with a modern ROS Distro, so you will need to build it yourself and then provide it to your students.\u00a0[Follow these\u00a0instructions](https://youtu.be/59F6Jake_48) to build a ROS VM image with the latest ROS Distro.\n3. Students use a ROS based docker. This is a similar approach to the previous one, more modern, but a little bit more complex for the students because they need to understand the usage of dockers. Follow the instructions here to download a ROS docker:\u00a0[https://hub.docker.com/\\_/ros/](https://hub.docker.com/_/ros/).\n4. Students use the\u00a0[Robot Ignite Academy](https://www.theconstructsim.com/teach-ros-effectively-v1-2/) web based environment.\u00a0We have developed this platform at [The Construct](https://www.theconstructsim.com/), which is a web-based ROS environment, where students do not have to install anything in their computers, and works with any type of computer. It provides the lessons, exercises, forum, and exams ready to use. Everything ready for the teacher to apply his magic as a teacher!\n\nWith any of those options, your students will have a running ROS environment that will allow them to create ROS programs and test them on simulated robots. That is definitely a step forward in the quality of the robotics teachings, and I would say that is 100% necessary for a proper robotics education.\n\nBut you can still move further in terms of quality.\n\nReal robot based environment for students\n\nIf you really want to provide your remote students a robotics experience, then you need to provide real robot testing and interactions. That is a tricky thing in remote situations, but I found two ways of providing this (after all that is my job, both as University teacher and as CEO of The Construct):\n\n1. In case you are teaching basic robotics stuff, you may include in your students package a real robot building kit. For around 200$ you can buy a small real robot kit delivered at home. So if the money is not a problem and the subject of robotics your are teaching goes accordingly with the robot, then that would be an optimal solution. Get one of those robots delivered to the home of each of your students (or ask the students to buy it). This is one of the kits we at The Construct have bought, which even allows the use of deep learning algorithms:  \n\n   1. [The Jetson nano board developer kit](https://www.amazon.com/NVIDIA-Jetson-Nano-Developer-945-13450-0000-100/dp/B084DSDDLT) (around 110$)\n   2. [The Jetbot kit for Jetson Nano](https://www.amazon.com/waveshare-JetBot-Kit-Jetson-Nano/dp/B082FNZ96R) (around 110$)\n2. In case you need some more complex robots to practice, or in case you cannot afford to get a robot to each one of the students homes, then you can allow students to remotely connect to the robots of your lab. The process to achieve that connection is quite simple and I described it in this video.\n\n[https://youtu.be/fzogfWRamDI](https://youtu.be/fzogfWRamDI)\n\nRead more at [https://www.theconstructsim.com/teaching-robotics-from-home/](https://www.theconstructsim.com/teaching-robotics-from-home/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "robots", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qkdp", "subreddit_subscribers": 20412, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Teaching Robotics to University Students from Home", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/robots/comments/hsa1dg/teaching_robotics_to_university_students_from_home/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1594907643.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "benevolentbruin689", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6o694cv2", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1594660563, "domain": "self.benevolentbruin689", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/u_benevolentbruin689/comments/hqjetx/the_ap_chemistry_guide/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hqjetx", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/u_benevolentbruin689/comments/hqjetx/the_ap_chemistry_guide/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "iciGusS_v6QfhiqlDfO8Y8C01qx2QCxsX8egzu4b02c", "resolutions": [{"height": 56, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/_Iayi3fM55lbKX-jknajsb4Qk-Wai5Gu7fZzSh9HhW0.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83192b9233eac799c5b84e6718a2a73cb94f8523", "width": 108}, {"height": 113, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/_Iayi3fM55lbKX-jknajsb4Qk-Wai5Gu7fZzSh9HhW0.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9b0e125470508aaa86168fe7e6574c9bea32ad2", "width": 216}, {"height": 168, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/_Iayi3fM55lbKX-jknajsb4Qk-Wai5Gu7fZzSh9HhW0.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c932d6992170495d9b341a53ce766fc9873f577d", "width": 320}, {"height": 336, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/_Iayi3fM55lbKX-jknajsb4Qk-Wai5Gu7fZzSh9HhW0.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5d33207398100e64a21af6c061da2bbd0815bd1", "width": 640}, {"height": 504, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/_Iayi3fM55lbKX-jknajsb4Qk-Wai5Gu7fZzSh9HhW0.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b3fd0b46ff425d1e3b05b85c7258955a115732b", "width": 960}, {"height": 567, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/_Iayi3fM55lbKX-jknajsb4Qk-Wai5Gu7fZzSh9HhW0.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d574a96a3b09a05ec8696a28816659d8bbfc409", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 630, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/_Iayi3fM55lbKX-jknajsb4Qk-Wai5Gu7fZzSh9HhW0.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=39fc7d213f054c9fa11c62dd273f8b3412c8446d", "width": 1200}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1594660593, "score": 1, "selftext": "If you think something is missing from this document, please comment down below!

Chemistry Problem Solving\u00a0\n5. Understanding Concepts\n6. Things to Memorize\n7. AP Exam Tips\n\n**Introduction**\n\nAP Chemistry (AP Chem) is an introductory first-year college general chemistry class. It is a level higher than your normal or honors high school chemistry class, simply since it covers more material in a shorter amount of time. You will be learning about chemical structure, chemical calculations, states of matter, chemical reactions, equilibrium, kinetics, acids and bases, and thermochemistry. You should recall most of these from a high-school level chemistry class, depending on your school and your teacher. However, AP Chemistry goes into much more detail in each of these topics.\u00a0\n\nIn addition to learning about the chemical theory, a very important portion of the class is to conduct experiments and write lab reports about chemistry. These are selected by your teacher to reflect what you learn in class. Oftentimes, these lab reports are worth a pretty significant chunk of your grade, so take them seriously. However, the labs are often very interesting and can help you see what is going on, especially when the theory gets abstract. Furthermore, if you try during the school year, the lab-based questions on the AP exam will be easier as well.\n\n**Should I take this class?**\n\nAP Chemistry is a very worthwhile class despite being arguably one of the hardest classes in the AP program. If you\u2019re a prospective engineering, pre-med, biology, or chemistry student, this is a useful class to take. It can get you out of the annoying weeder general chemistry class during your first year at university. If you\u2019re not looking for college credit, it\u2019s still a good option if you want to challenge yourself in a STEM class!\n\nIf you haven\u2019t had any exposure to chemistry, I would suggest that you hold off on taking AP Chem. You really hit the ground running in this class - there\u2019s no easing into the subject. Therefore, in order to succeed, you should have at least a bit of knowledge about chemical structure and stoichiometry at the minimum. This is not to say, however, that an honors chemistry course is absolutely necessary to your success. You can learn a bit of the material in the summer using some online resources; some of these are provided under the section \u201cAP Exam Tips\u201d.\n\nAlso make sure to keep your math skills on-point. Although the math only hangs around the level of Algebra 2 or precalculus, it helps to review some concepts from these classes. The majority of the class consists of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. There\u2019s also a considerable amount of formula manipulation (e.g.: if ab = xy solve for x in terms of the other variables). However some later concepts rely heavily on logarithms (both common logs and natural logs); if you\u2019re not comfortable with that make sure to review that. Make sure to have a good scientific or graphing calculator (though I recommend the former) for the free response section. Also work on that mental math! The multiple choice section asks you to perform some basic calculations but a calculator is not permitted. Calculus is not at all necessary for this class, though it can shed light on the origin of the *integrated* rate law\u2026\n\nFinally, perhaps most importantly, ask yourself if you\u2019re willing to spend a significant chunk of your time studying chemistry. Like I said earlier, it\u2019s a hard class. There are going to be days when the homework, lab reports, or tests take up a lot of your schedule, and it may seem unmanageable with everything else you have. Just make sure you don\u2019t procrastinate and study effectively. If you want some general tips on how to efficiently study, I have another piece written that may help you out.\n\n**What to do in the summer**\n\nLike I said in the previous section, it\u2019s important to brush up on some previous chemistry or math skills. For the math skills, just pull out your old algebra textbook and do some problems until you memorize the logarithm rules or you feel comfortable with formula manipulation. Summer is a great time to get a head start on some of the chemistry material as well. Try Khan Academy or the Organic Chemistry Tutor for some help - I\u2019ll have links to them in the \u201cAP Exam Tips\u201d section.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that your teacher has assigned some summer work as well. Make sure to do these - it either means your teacher will briefly go over these concepts at the start of the year or they\u2019ll skip over them entirely. This is also another good opportunity for you to revisit some of the stuff you may have forgotten from honors chemistry.\n\n**Chemistry Problem Solving**\n\nBecause you will be dealing with a considerable amount of quantitative analysis in your chemistry class, it\u2019s important to know how to solve problems effectively. Fortunately, most problems should be trivial if you memorize how to do them. Essentially it is: recognizing what the question is asking, knowing the right formula to use, knowing the right steps to follow, and then plug and chug on your calculator. The more practice problems you do, the easier it will be for you to recognize what to do on an exam. For example, stoichiometry problems generally require you to use a balanced equation to find a mole relationship between two substances, and then use dimensional analysis to determine the value in question. There are only so many variations of these problems, so the key is to do a lot of practice.\n\nOne of the more annoying parts of chemistry is the usage of significant figures. There are some important rules for sig figs, and they will cost you points on labs and assignments if you don\u2019t follow them. You should have had exposure to these in regular chemistry. It\u2019ll take a while to get used to them if you\u2019ve never taken chemistry, but after a while it usually becomes second nature.\n\nThe AP exam comes with a formula sheet. This covers pretty much all the equations you will be using on the exam. Use it as a reference table in case you forget something, like if you forget the Ideal Gas Law (hopefully not, though). However you shouldn\u2019t expect the formula sheet to shed any light on how to solve the problems. That comes from expertise and practice during your time studying for the exam. If you\u2019ve done enough practice, the formula sheet may not even be necessary since the relevant formulae have been ingrained into your mind at that point.\n\nHere are some more miscellaneous points that I also want to cover but don\u2019t want to devote an entire paragraph towards:\n\n* Pay attention to units. It\u2019ll be a shame to lose some points if you accidentally use mL instead of L in a molarity calculation.\n* Instead of plugging in numbers right away, rearrange the equation to solve for the variable in question in terms of the other variables. This helps you avoid calculator error and helps you keep track of units.\n* Balance the equation correctly. This is the foundation of most lengthy problems in chemistry. If you get the equation wrong the rest of your work will be wrong as well.\n* Use the simplifying assumption whenever possible. Believe me, solving the quadratic formula under a time constraint without F2 - solve on a graphing calculator is not fun.\n* Organize your work in a way that you won\u2019t get lost. Lengthy acid-base problems require multiple steps, so make sure that you can follow your work to avoid confusion when you\u2019re checking your answers.\n* Double check your work at the end. If at the end of a stoichiometry problem you get 38 kg of salt when you start with 0.50 g of HCl, you\u2019re probably doing something wrong. If you want to check a specific value, plug your answer back into the equation to see if it makes sense.\n\n**Understanding Concepts**\n\nI\u2019ve spent a lot of time discussing mathematical skills and quantitative chemistry. Oftentimes, the most difficult part of AP Chemistry is understanding the theory that is operating behind all the calculations. It\u2019s one thing to know a process inside and out of calculating a value, but it\u2019s also important to understand why that is. Chemistry is not for everyone. For some people, it just comes naturally to them, so they don\u2019t need to spend extra time figuring out why something is. For others, chemistry may be extremely abstract and complex. They would likely need to spend more time on the subject to truly grasp the essence of the concepts.\n\nBecause of this, it\u2019s difficult for me to write specific tips tailored to everyone. What I will say is, don\u2019t be afraid to seek help from a teacher, the internet, or your peers whenever you need it. Whether you just want to clarify something or you\u2019re absolutely lost, seek help! If you feel like you understand something, try explaining it to a friend. If you can coherently express your understanding of chemistry to them, that is a good indication that you know the concepts very well.\n\nAn oftentimes underrated resource is your chemistry textbook. Your teacher probably selected one for a reason; it\u2019s not there just for them to assign homework problems out of. If you don\u2019t like your chemistry textbook, try Library Genesis, which allows you to download popular texts like *Zumdahl* or *Chemistry: The Central Science*. Read and understand the relevant sections of the text if you\u2019re confused about something. If you encounter something especially abstract, reread the text until you fully understand it.\u00a0\n\n**Things to Memorize**\n\nHere is a list of some of the things I think are the most important things in all of AP Chemistry, qualitatively speaking. Like I said earlier, equations and problem solving tips are easy to remember, but there are a lot of conceptual details that make up a significant portion of your understanding of chemistry. This is not meant to be an exhaustive list; if I made a list of everything you should memorize, this article would be needlessly long. These are just things that I\u2019ve found were the most useful in my time of taking AP Chemistry.\n\nIf you find it difficult to commit things to memory, it helps to do a lot of practice. Once you do problems and answer enough questions, these things will become second nature to you. If you\u2019re still having some trouble, mnemonic devices can certainly help a lot.\n\n* *List of polyatomic ions*: oftentimes, you will be asked to write net-ionic reactions. A knowledge of the polyatomic ions and their respective charges is very helpful to these types of questions. When you write chemical equations, it\u2019s useful to know these too, or else the stoichiometry may be extremely difficult.\n* *Solubility Rules*: if you want to know whether some compound dissolves in solution or not, it\u2019s often useful to memorize the solubility rules. Although you won\u2019t need to know every detail, it\u2019s useful to avoid making silly mistakes on an otherwise easy question.\n* *Periodic Trends*: when you get your periodic table, it\u2019s useful to immediately draw arrows across it to represent increasing nuclear radius, ionic radius, ionization energy, electronegativity, and the like. That way when you get to a multiple choice question that asks you to do this, you can quickly select the correct answer.\n* *The Lewis Dot Rules, VSEPR Model*: again, if you know how to draw a Lewis structure of something and minimize formal charge, this is something that will help you immensely in some of the Free Response questions. Additionally, it should be free points if a multiple choice question asks you to name the molecular geometry...if you are able to categorize them as such.\n* *Organic Functional Groups*: admittedly, this is a smaller part of the exam, but being able to name certain organic compounds off the top of your head and knowing the properties of the substance can help you in conjunction with other topics like acids/bases\n* *Le Chatelier\u2019s Principle*: while this is something that you\u2019re better off understanding, it can help you when you want to determine the effects of changing concentration, temperature, or pressure/volume on a system in equilibrium\n* *Directions of Thermodynamic Changes*: another quality-of-life improvement is to simply memorize what the signs of \u2206H and \u2206S mean in the context of a chemical reaction; it\u2019s important to learn why that\u2019s the case, but it can save you time and help you avoid make conceptual errors when you try to rationalize why the chemical equation should change in a particular way when heat is involved\n* *Electrochemistry Rules*: memorize the parts of a galvanic cell or an electrolytic cell because the Free Response often asks you to label these parts. Also remember: LEO the lion says GER (lose electrons oxidation, gain electrons reduction)\n\n**AP Exam Tips**\n\nAs with other STEM AP tests, the most important thing you can do at the end of the year in preparation for the AP exam is to practice. There are tons of resources online to help you do this. You can also ask your teacher for a full released exam for practice as well. As a general rule of thumb, I don\u2019t think test prep books are useful in the context of AP prep; the questions are often level higher than what you would normally expect on a College Board test. However, if you\u2019re interested in buying one, I liked Barron\u2019s for its explanations of concepts. In the meantime, here are some good resources that I liked to use during AP prep season.\n\n* [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/): I always speak of Khan Academy as one of the best free resources on the Internet. It truly lives up to this title for AP Chemistry. It has a lot of videos that go into various degrees of detail about virtually all important concepts in chemistry. You should definitely use this over the course of the school year whenever you are confused about something. Similarly, if you want to brush up on a concept that may have left your mind, this is great for that as well.\n* [The Organic Chemistry Tutor](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEWpbFLzoYGPfuWUMFPSaoA): similar to Khan Academy, the Organic Chemistry Tutor is one of the best free resources out there. He also has videos on virtually every topic. I think the best part about his videos is the fact that he has a lot of worked examples to go along with the content. If you\u2019re forgetting how to solve a buffer equilibrium question, there\u2019s definitely an easy video you can find for that.\n* [Coursera Chemistry](https://www.coursera.org/learn/chemistry-1): this is a good resource for those of you that want to brush up on chemistry and/or get ahead a bit in the summer. The University of Kentucky has a MOOC on Coursera that teaches you chemistry equivalent to that of a first-year college class. There are some topics that are not in the AP curriculum, but if you want a \u201cclass\u201d that is organized and easy to follow, and a playlist of Youtube videos won\u2019t cut it for you, I highly recommend you check this out. In fact, I\u2019m using it to brush up on some Chemistry right now!\n* [Past FRQs](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-chemistry/exam/past-exam-questions): if you\u2019re looking for some extra practice, and you want to know what types of questions will be asked when you take the AP exam for real, look no further than some previous-years FRQs. Keep in mind the curriculum has shifted quite a bit, so certain calculations on earlier problem sets may no longer be relevant.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "u_benevolentbruin689", "subreddit_id": "t5_2pzg4e", "subreddit_subscribers": 0, "subreddit_type": "user", "suggested_sort": "qa", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The AP Chemistry Guide", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/u_benevolentbruin689/comments/hqjetx/the_ap_chemistry_guide/", "created": 1594660563.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Soldierducky", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_79en7", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1594574606, "domain": "self.learnmachinelearning", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/hpy502/mini_rant_feeling_really_dejected_after/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hpy502", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/hpy502/mini_rant_feeling_really_dejected_after/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "DfXngGnlOR3XS3P4UpsmWT0n-0mrC6Ha1kF1b_On2vo", "resolutions": [{"height": 56, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/8ug1vl2kD_l-qX_YCCHpDAAKbTT3pTL1cO5Ky8TKVdM.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6e35f658a85e252b0d64a0aad4998cc2399f08f", "width": 108}, {"height": 113, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/8ug1vl2kD_l-qX_YCCHpDAAKbTT3pTL1cO5Ky8TKVdM.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b815728aa2df044f3269f0e4baeac83ff51ba3f", "width": 216}, {"height": 167, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/8ug1vl2kD_l-qX_YCCHpDAAKbTT3pTL1cO5Ky8TKVdM.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbedb1e6aaee6e901b6d67cfb7ded2f349c0be9b", "width": 320}, {"height": 335, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/8ug1vl2kD_l-qX_YCCHpDAAKbTT3pTL1cO5Ky8TKVdM.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbd95e00f64e8dc445c65d86327a772981639c74", "width": 640}, {"height": 502, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/8ug1vl2kD_l-qX_YCCHpDAAKbTT3pTL1cO5Ky8TKVdM.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebbc0bf26a3baf6849e6f88eaafcd54f5bde7367", "width": 960}, {"height": 565, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/8ug1vl2kD_l-qX_YCCHpDAAKbTT3pTL1cO5Ky8TKVdM.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df67316f81c3817e1497443c1b0f8e1aef2a5689", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 928, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/8ug1vl2kD_l-qX_YCCHpDAAKbTT3pTL1cO5Ky8TKVdM.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=aa18d5861ec23114b15cd02066071275bf0dcfb1", "width": 1772}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1594574636, "score": 1, "selftext": "TLDR: Due to the weak background in python in general, I got destroyed by a basic \"hand-holding\" ML course.

Amazon also has a ton of rash guards that would work for guys or girls, and swimdresses. I just ordered\u00a0[this one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XM5TQ65/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_0xO5Eb2FJ4EEK)\u00a0and it comes to mid-thigh. There are also\u00a0[board shorts](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GKCA0SY/ref=twister_B07Q24V7RH?th=1).\nCoverups are also beachy and comfortable. When you're in the water, people don't see your legs anyway, and when you're out, you can wrap up and not worry about it. Of course, no one says you have to cover if you're comfortable!\n\nOne thing that really helps me is [urge surfing](https://portlandpsychotherapy.com/2011/11/riding-wave-using-mindfulness-help-cope-urges/). There's something about picturing an urge like a wave, that will peak and pass, that helps me ride it out.\n\nAlso CalmHarm, DBT Coach, and Breathe by Dr. Jud have been helpful apps.\n\nOpen a window and let some light in.\n\nReach out to a friend. You don't have to talk about what's going on if you don't want to, just having a distraction helps. If you feel you're a little short on friends or like you can't open up to the ones you have, focus on building your support system wherever, however you can.\n\nLook for a support group. I found a 12-step program (Celebrate Recovery) invaluable. Having other people around who know what you're up against, who are willing to walk with you, can be a huge relief. Of course, it's harder right now to attend groups but you could probably find something online or reach out to a local chapter and see if they're streaming meetings. There are non profits streaming support groups and many therapists are also offering phone or video sessions, worth looking around. \n\nDecide to watch something first, before hurting yourself. Ryan Hamilton on Netflix is hysterical.\n\nChange location. I'm less likely to hurt myself in public, even if that means taking a walk down the street or sitting on my porch. However if I'm feeling impulsive and unsafe (suicidal), I know I need to stay home and try a different approach or contact my therapist.\n\nAnother thing that helps me is to HALT (ask yourself if you are hungry, angry, lonely or tired, and if you are, address the immediate need). I also add an \"O\" for overwhelmed because I know I'm prone to self harm if I really need to take a break/step back from a situation, do some self care, or say no to someone. Just identifying what's going on can help you move through it.\n\nWhen I journal or write crappy poetry or a letter I won't send or do some art, it keeps my hands busy while I'm feeling the urge, and it gives those feelings somewhere to go to be processed. Doesn't matter if the art was good or not because \"good\" wasn't the point, and so I affectionately refer to this as Shitty Art Tuesday, where things don't need to be perfect or good, just expressive. Helps the urge or feeling to be heard.\n\n[Box breathing and 54321 grounding](https://www.evergreenyfs.org/Youth%20Anxiety%20Handouts.pdf)\u00a0are worth a try. I always scoffed when someone suggested \"just breathe,\" because it seems dismissive, but then I actually tried it lol. With grounding, sometimes if I'm having a panic attack or if I'm dissociating, someone will do this with me and prompt me to focus, but I can also do it on my own.\n\nPut your feet in the grass and look up. Notice the flowers, rocks, whatever is in your yard. If you don't have a yard, notice whatever beautiful thing is around you.\n\nRemember it's okay to feel like doing something but then not do it. Just because it's on your mind doesn't mean you have to act. You're in charge. Of course, the other side to this is that you can choose to hurt yourself, too\n\nMake a self care kit. Lots of great ideas on pinterest.\n\nTalk back to the negative voice in your head. All it does is be mean and tell lies. It can f off.\n\n[Some thoughts on alternatives](https://www.talkspace.com/blog/time-retire-self-harm-alternatives/) (like ice cubes, snapping rubber bands, etc). Has some good points but I think these methods can be useful for some and harmful to others. \n\nIf you have a library card and online access, check out some of the self harm workbooks available. Hope and Healing for Kids Who Cut by Marv Penner is a good book on self harm and I found it validating even as an adult. The Mindfulness Workbook for Teen Self Harm by Gina Biegel. If you've had any trauma in your life (a lot of us have), The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk and Complex PTSD by Pete Walker are eye opening. Of course there are lots of books on these topics, but all of these are on Hoopla.\n\nIf trauma is relevant to you, you can find a lot of support at r/cptsd (you don't have to have this diagnosis to join). EMDR therapy is also effective for treating trauma. \n\nTry something new. I've been learning to bake bread which is nice because kneading is cathartic and the results are yummy.\n\n[The Science of Well-Being](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being) Yale class - free\n\nIt can take 5-10 good coping skills to replace 1 bad one and nothing will feel the same. Nothing will be so instantly gratifying- that's okay, it doesn't need to be. Different skills work for different situations. It's more about creating time and space between urge and action, to slow the roll. Every time you make that choice, you stretch that muscle. It also helps strengthen healthy neuropathways, and the more you practice the more the old pathways grow over. We all have a healthy and an unhealthy self and the one that grows is the one you feed. Creating space gives your healthy self a chance to grow.\n\nI'm sure you all know that self harm is a symptom. It helps to address the root issue, which can take a lot of time and effort to figure out. That's okay. You don't even have to want to stop to start recovery- you just have to not like where you're at. Also remember that recovery is a process, not perfection or a destination.  Relapse doesn't negate the time you went without it and you aren't starting over from square one. Instead relapse, slips, and urges highlight areas we still need to work on, so keep fighting and patient with yourself. You're on your way! It helps to have a professional in your corner to figure it out together. \n\nHope something here is useful and that you find what works for you.
