any of this, I'm just a student trying to help others. This guide may apply to other languages (Though you need to look for the resources yourself).\n\n**In summary:** I wanna help you and here is how.\n\n**SECTION I: Phonetics**\n\nI had some issues with pronunciation, so I took a course on [American English Pronunciation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/american-english-pronunciation) which teaches you the essential phonetics of the language, I didn't really finished it I just cared about the phonetics, It's free if you don't want the certificate. (I only did the 2 first courses, The consonants and the vowels)\n\n^(If you're learning another language besides English you should look for a similar course for that language)\n\n***What are phonetics? And why should I care?*** \"Phonetics is a branch of linguistics that studies how humans produce and perceive sounds\". Very dedicated people studied each sound a human is able to make and assigned a symbol to it (called API symbols) and also studied how to make those sounds, let's see the words \"[This](https://www.wordreference.com/definition/this)\" and \"[Think](https://www.wordreference.com/definition/think)\",they are represented phonetically like **/\u00f0\u026as/** and **/\u03b8\u026a\u014bk/** respectively, although both words start with \"th\" they are pronounced differently, for beginners these littlenesses can be difficult to notice and many would end up pronouncing both words with \"**\u00f0**\" or \"**\u03b8**\" so it's a good idea to have some basic knowledge of the subject from the start. It also helps you distinguish similar sounds easier like \"p\" and \"b\" in \"[Park](https://www.wordreference.com/definition/Park)\" and \"[Bark](https://www.wordreference.com/definition/Bark)\".\n\n***I don't wanna learn American Accent, British Accent rocks.*** It's fine, you don't have to, a gentleman (or gentlewoman) was kind enough to compile a series of resources that can help you with that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/mtqvha/do_you_know_of_any_british_english_pronunciation/gv23lie?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and to clarify some things about the British Accent. If you struggle with a specific sound you can google \"How to make x sound in Received Pronounciation\"(In the x you put the API symbol) for more instructions on how you should control your articulatory system to achieve the sound.\n\n***Alright, I get it, but how am I supposed to remember every sound? Am I supposed to remember each symbol?*** You don't need to remember the sounds nor any symbol, but rather remember each word as a whole, and using the symbols only as a guide when needed, sounds hard but there's no way around it.\n\nThankfully we live in a modern era with tons of tools to help us in this process.\n\n**SECTION II: Anki**\n\nIf you're familiar with anki, skip to section III\n\n***What's anki?*** \"Anki is a program which makes remembering things easy. Because it's a lot more efficient than traditional study methods, you can either greatly decrease your time spent studying, or greatly increase the amount you learn.\"- From anki's webpage. That doesn't really answers any questions, does it? Anki is a flashcard program, in one side of the flashcard you have the \"question\" and in the other side you have the \"answer\".\n\n***What's so special about it?*** Anki uses a Space Repetition System (SRS) to help you remember things, and it supports a variety of things like mp3 files, images and videos in your flashcards (But we're only going to use mp3 files)\n\n***SRS?*** \"The SRS (Spaced Repetition System) is a presentation method that gives you the information *before you would forget it* and makes sure that it stays constantly fresh in your mind. So, you might see a word a few minutes after the first time, then a few *days* later, then a few *weeks* later etc. always at the time you need to see it most to make sure it is constantly fresh in your mind.\" -from [this](https://www.fluentin3months.com/spaced-repetition/) page\n\nGet anki from [here](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), it's available for all mainstream platforms\n\n**SECTION III: Remembering with Anki**\n\nWe might be able to pronounce some words correctly but we often find ourselves forgetting how to pronounce them. This might help you with it.\n\nNow we have all the elements necessary to make a powerful deck to help us remember how to pronounce words. When you find a word that's difficult to pronounce for you, you get the audio (more on this later), look for its phonetical pronunciation (in [here](https://www.wordreference.com/)) and make a flashcard.\n\n***Wait, you're going too fast.*** It's okay, just read. I'm not going to go much in depth about how to make flashcards. To add a flashcard to your deck you click on \"Add\" (I'm using the pc version of anki). In the \"front\" section you write the word, and in the \"back\" section you put the audio file (click on the clip button and look for the proper mp3 file) and also write the phonetical pronunciation. An example would be: **Front:** Maintain **Back:** /me\u026an\u02c8te\u026an/ \\[sound:maintain--\\_us\\_1.mp3\\]. (See image 1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Image 1](https://preview.redd.it/u27dd8m8j3u61.png?width=451&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da60754f6bc1111b771c120af9bbbf28ea8d4632)\n\n***How to get audio files?*** This is more or less complicated and tedious. But here's an easy way:\n\n[American pronunciation](https://ssl.gstatic.com/dictionary/static/sounds/oxford/word--_us_1.mp3): https://ssl.gstatic.com/dictionary/static/sounds/oxford/**word**\\--\\_us\\_1.mp3\n\n[British pronunciation](https://ssl.gstatic.com/dictionary/static/sounds/oxford/word--_gb_1.mp3): https://ssl.gstatic.com/dictionary/static/sounds/oxford/**word**\\--\\_gb\\_1.mp3\n\n**What the heck is this?** It's a link to the audio files of oxford's dictionary, here's how we're going to use it: Where you see the word \"**word**\" you change it to any word you want, example: \n\nFor \"**junlge**\" \n\nhttps://ssl.gstatic.com/dictionary/static/sounds/oxford/**jungle**\\--\\_us\\_1.mp3 \n\n(It doesn't works with some conjugated words, for example, if you look for \"worked\" you might get a 404 error)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fi77hqodl3u61.png?width=344&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9618e4f7a27efc96a1e00b71338caff860b81ee\n\nOnce you're in the page of the audio file just click the three dots (...) and download it.\n\n^(I'm going to make another post on how to get audio files from other sorces in more detail.)\n\nCongrats! You now can make an anki deck with all the words that are difficult to pronounce for you.\n\n***Now, how do I use this deck?*** Simple, review your deck, when you see the word, try to pronounce it, click on \"show  answer\" (see image 2) and if you pronounced it correctly click on \"Good\" otherwise click on \"Again\" (see image 3)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Image 2](https://preview.redd.it/x8q0b7caj3u61.png?width=400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1194d8575ace939b3fe6c25ef6652be1791e7a8d)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Image 3](https://preview.redd.it/8np9kdbcj3u61.png?width=395&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b121ca8c8cea0d9132f860e2cfb33e4c919de530)\n\n**TIPS**\n\n**This is only a helpul method, it's not a magical solution, it's just a gear piece of a big engine.** You need to listen a lot, a LOT of the spoken language and speak it yourself, only hard work will make you fluent.\n\n**This is not the rule.** If you don't see yourself doing any of this, it's fine there are more ways in which you can achieve what you want, I'm only making this post in hope to help others, I'm not claiming this is the way you should learn but rather the way that was helpful for me.\n\n**Only use this method if you already know the meaning of the word.** Learning words by their own can be misleading, many words have different meanings depending on what context they're used in, If you want to learn new words, learn them in context. Example, let's say you want to learn the word \"throw\" making a flashcard with just \"throw\" and it's meaning in your mother tongue isn't very helpful. It's easier to remember \"I threw an apple in my teacher's face\" it sounds interesting, funny and that helps you remember it better and you can also see in which cases the word is used.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks a lot for reading this long post, I hope it serves you in any way.\n\nIf you have any suggestions on what I should add to this post, let me know.\n\nEnglish it's not my first language, sorry if I made any mistakes and I'd appreciate if you correct me.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "languagelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjsc", "subreddit_subscribers": 394091, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/qJZXA8BdGy51zvgIhdg_gdGdqEzBbYb_Lv2z-RUBlWo.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 121, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "How to have better pronunciation?

But today I'm here to share 3 main tips to those who may not have such a portfolio and what they could do to improve it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Think Big Start Small**\n\nOnly you can decide your measures of success as ultimately, you are the one who will be graduating from poly. Honestly, success does not necessarily define having a good acad portfolio. Well, it is good to aim to study well, it is more fruitful to have a goal of having a strong engineering foundation so that you can harness it when you are working or pursuing higher studies. Don't just sign up for CCAs or take up courses just for the points or the cert. Do it because you are passionate abt learning the skill set. \n\nSimple things like I hope I can improve my presentation skills in front of a group of ppl by grad is a means of success already. We all get too hooked up with focusing on the big measure of success but in reality, it's these small goals that will help us achieve the big ones progressively.\n\nHaving well-defined goals as well as the measure of success are important because they underline the reasons for your passions &amp; motivations to execute the required actions well. \n\nThink Big, Start Small. Having a big goal, as well as having smaller attainable goals that progress to the big goal is important. \n\nFor example, your goal may be to learning to code in a particular language. Start having simple goals by learning the syntax, then apply your acquired knowledge in some practices and progressively moving on to the next levels before mastering it. Or if you are in an OJT setting, layout what are the things u need to know and develop a plan whereby you only master the essentials functions and map out how you can apply them in your job/intern. It's perfectly fine if you make mistakes, even I make mistakes, in the process. These mistakes will be important in improving your style of learning.\n\nFrom my experience in poly, this mindset was beneficial in being consistent in learning new things, be it studies or CCA or intern. \n\nWhatever grade u may be in, if u can master this simple technique of learning and adapting the goals to overcome challenges, you are bound to excel in future.\n\nThis course in Coursera (free btw) provides useful ways to develop an effective learning mindset in which I learnt some useful techniques. Highly recommend for ppl who want to improve their learning style. It's a good, verified resource that anyone can do it OTOT.\n\n[https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Develop good networks with people**\n\nVery important. A lot of progress I made in poly would not have been possible without the support of my classmates, friends I made in diff camps, seminars or events besides my family. Having a positive group of friends who are willing to help each other out is essential as it is near to impossible for someone to just solo project work &amp; assignments or even exams throughout poly. \n\nNot only you will make progress, but you will grow as a better person. Now u may ask, how can I find such ppl? Well, you can do your best to try to network with people, and that includes lecturers and industry ppl as well. A lot of times, we don't try to network ppl after events and camps coz paiseh of the fear of rejection &amp; prejudice. As the saying goes, never try never know.\n\nThis is important for those guys who want to self source internship, where contacts with industry ppl or seniors or current students can potentially help you land at the internship of your choice. The same applies to scholarships.\n\nMy recommendation is to attend those general or industry-related seminars, events, camps, workshops, zoom meetings that normally comes in ur ichat. Linkedin is also a good place to start. Once I randomly just signed for a talk abt Learning Express without even knowing what is it abt. And guess what? I learned that there was such a thing as called overseas social innovation project (OSIP) and the application procedures. And Voila! Managed to get in through and had such meaningful experiences throughout the trip. Made good connections with my project mates and overseas counterparts whom I am still in contact with this day!\n\nSometimes you may not understand what's gg on, but these are golden opportunities to meet new ppl and get new perspectives. If you make the effort to understand, ppl are more likely to help you.  Try to network on a neutral note first, and once the communication between you and the other party is well established, then only you can attempt to ask for what u want.  It makes the connection more meaningful and lasts longer. \n\nThe key here is to be open and be bold to network ppl who may or may not be in the same frequency as you. This can come crucial in interviews in jobs or scholarships where your portfolios may be outmatched by better portfolios. Networking can give you an edge over others in these situations.\n\nP.s: In fact, your networking can start right here in Reddit, and in this very subreddit forum itself :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Consistency IN Explore OUT**\n\nThere are things that I did that went well and some that didn't turn out well wish I wished I could have done better. I'm being brutally honest, it wasn't an easier journey here, nor it was something I visualised when I started in poly as I never imagined doing this well in poly at Y1. The point here is, your expectations at the start and the end result will not be the same. The qn is, how willing are you to get your path set by the system or how willing are you to crave your path.\n\nThe way I went about in poly is through being consistent in academics and exploring out in learning new skills and improving them. I did my best in helping my peers and myself on what are the ways where we could improve, esp in project work, and reflect on actions. The three sub-points are my takeaways from adopting this method\n\n***For FRESHMEN ESPECIALLY, MAKE SURE YOU DO WELL FOR FIRST SEM.*** \n\nI know poly is a new environment and a lot of exciting opportunities that you can experience ahead, but I, on behalf of most poly grads, advise that you may wanna spend much attention of your first sem in establishing a good acad standpoint so that GPA does not become a barrier for you to pursue your interests in subsequent semesters.\n\nI cannot stress this point any better as I have seen my friends who have made wrong decisions and as a result, they didn't farewell for their first sem, which stung them till grad.\n\nIt's perfectly fine if you make mistakes here and there, coz that is part and parcel of adapting to poly curriculum. What is wrong is that if you did not give your best, then u have yourself to blame for. Give it your best shot. \n\nEg, for me it's not that I did extremely well for all the modules in my first sem, in fact, I almost ended up getting a C+ for Narrative Writing (GE2) coz I did not understand some parts of it initially and I assumed that time that this was something not of importance to deal with. \n\nHaving uncooperative project group members, loads of abstract theoretical knowledge and/or practical knowledge to absorb, strict lecturers, the complicated structure of mods and BELL CURVE are some of the many factors that you can't change or have limited power to change in a typical poly sem. What determines your progress is to react and change accordingly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***FOR CURRENT ENGINEERING GUYS OUT THERE, DO PLAN AHEAD OF WHAT YOU INTEND TO LEARN AND APPLY IN ENGINEERING WHILE STUDYING***\n\nI would encourage you to take up mini projects if your course doesn't have FYP or you can do further improvements on past projects that you did in the course because the applied practical knowledge is far more valuable than anything. Having good theory knowledge is good for the exams, but having good team management skills with solid application-oriented knowledge is vital to be relevant in the industries.\n\nPoly curriculum does give the hands-on experience, but if you want to be better at engineering, you have to explore it out yourself at times. That's the explore part of my strategy. Don't just depend on sch. Go further and take actions to enhance your knowledge, or innovate. Whether you fail or succeed in completing projects or initiatives doesnt matter. The process you go through counts. Focus on the process and not the product. PM me if you are looking for opportunities to build your engineering portfolio. I'll be more than happy to help you out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPerhaps the best part of my poly life was intern, where I had the opportunity to work and come up with a solution project for one of the company's challenges. It taught me far more lessons abt working life than sch would have taught. It was the period of time where I got introduced to data science, ML and python. For someone who was deeply interested in avionics, this was something out of the box. Eventually, I managed to learn the basics of data science and am interested to learn more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTherefore, even if u do not have the time to OTOT do projects, use the internship as a great tool to expand your horizon of engineering expertise. Now I know some intern companies just ask you to do what is assigned of you and that itself can be quite the heck of a load. To this group of ppl, try to change your perspective and see whether you can explore how your role affects the company operations, or you can independently improvise conditions at your work so that you can achieve better efficiency or anything that adds value to ur internship. Don't just go and work there just for the sake of it. Would suggest gg intern with an open mind and take initiatives to improve your work experience.\n\n**TLDR: ENGAGE IN INTERN PROACTIVELY OR INVOLVE IN ENGINEERING ACTIVITIES EITHER IN SCH OR OUTSIDE SCH CURRICULUM TO VALUE ADD TO YOUR PORTFOLIO**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***JUGGLING BETWEEN STUDYING AND EXPLORING SKILLS &amp; INTERESTS***   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is something that all poly guys wanna be good at. Tbh, there isn't a hard and fast rule to managing studies &amp; CCAs and other commitments. \"For each, it's own\", as the saying goes.\n\nThat being said, do plan ahead of your time ahead, ensuring enough time for mods, CCAs and other stuff. The poly timetable is pretty standard, so one tool that I have used to do well is to prepare ahead. Know what are the expectations and requirements of each module and seek help from tutorial lecturers and seniors. Do ask questions and don't be afraid to ask them. \n\nDon't skip tutorials. Tutorials are essential to consolidate your learning. It can potentially help you to get that A from B+ in exams.\n\nPlanning &amp; time management is one thing, but another important quality is to manage stress &amp; anxiety when things do not go the way you planned them, which happens for a lot of time.\n\nOne tip would be to forge good friendships within your course as they will be able to understand and feel your stress &amp; worries. Brings back to the topic of networking.\n\nThe other would be to review your expectations and adjust accordingly; back to the topic of think big, start small.\n\nHowever, the best advice is to take care of your health mentally &amp; physically. Your health comes first before everything. Make sure you take concrete steps to take good care of it. Diff people cope differently. For myself, I exercised often, like running, cycling etc. To keep stress to tolerable limits, I pause and reflect periodically on what could have been done better. I agree that at times, it ain't that easy to study for the pursuit of knowledge and would just want to do the minimum to score reasonably grades. So breaks and self-care are very important to keep you conditioned.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Conclusion**\n\nThanks for reading this far. I always wanted to make a comprehensive sharing of what I learnt in poly and what I wished I could have done better. I apologise if any content in this post has hurt or offended anyone as that is never my intention. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeel free to comment down below any questions about scholarship interview, SP engineering experience or SP life in general and I will answer them to the best of my ability. But as I'm an NSF rn, will take a bit of time to answer your queries but will try my best to answer asap. Alternatively, you can PM me your queries too!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.s: Typed out all during admin time so don't mind the bad paragraphing.\n\n# Remember. YOU are in charge of your life.

I'm going to give you the exact steps I took. \n\n**Background**:  \n\nI'm a 29 year old single mom. I became a mom at 21. I never graduated highschool, I only have a GED to this day. At first, I was a stay at home mom so didn't have to worry about money. Then I got divorced. I had a couple thousand in the bank and that was basically it. Then I worked a series of low paying service jobs and lived basically in poverty for about 1.5 years. But, I also spent that time learning. \n\n**My job**: \n\nI'm a product designer at a high growth tech startup. That means I design the user experience and user interfaces for web and native applications. My job involves: research, ideating, creating, testing, learning, collaborating, failing, winning, and being heavily critiqued. If you want to excel, you should be interested in: human behavior, psychology and building empathy. You should have (or be willing to learn) good people skills and good presentation skills. You will work with others often and showcasing your work will be a good part of what you do. Designers are often curious, detail oriented, and creative, but all of these skills can also be learned. \n\n**Common Myths/Fears**: \n\n1. **You have to know how to code**\n   1. No, you don't. But you will need to learn the basics about how code works and what it's capable of. Eventually, you will learn how to predict how much coding a effort a project will take. You need to be able to have conversations with developers, but they will explain things for the most part in human terms. Just a working knowledge of code is fine. More is better.\n2. **You have to be good at art/drawing/design.** \n   1. No, you can be absolutely terrible at all of it. You will never need to be good at art, don't worry about that. You will learn the art of UX sketching, which is simple and rudimentary. You will also learn how to design (through practicing predictable process and utilizing research to make design decisions.) Product design is not graphic design, it involves a visual design element but that's the last shiny 10% and you can learn this skill, there are already standards in place for it. I was god awful at all three of these things for quite a bit of time. Sticking with it is important. Of course, all three of these skills would be a bonus. \n3. **You have to get a fancy degree or attend a bootcamp**\n   1. No, you can teach yourself with everything available (free or paid) online. Your portfolio and interview skills will speak for you when you are breaking into the industry. It's ok and normal to be self taught, it is not looked down upon. However, it's not a bad thing if you'd like to go to school to pursue this. Be wary of bootcamps. \n\n**My Path:** \n\nWell for context, I kept working my shitty less than minimum wage job. \n\nThe first thing I did was read a bunch of articles about ux designers on smashingmagazine. I got the basic gist of what the job was and decided I was interested. I looked up the best books for ux designers and started to read read \"The design of everyday things\" by Don Norman, \"Sketching user experiences\" by Bill Buxton, \"Lean UX\" by Jeff Gothelf, and \"Don't make me think\" by Steve Krug. These books are all still ones I would recommend. \n\nThen I took classes on Coursera (you can apply for financial aid for each course, they always approve). Please note: since this was about 6-7 years ago now the class offerings have changed. These are the equivalents of what I took and what I'd recommend. \n\n1. [https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-ux-design](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-ux-design)\n2. [https://www.coursera.org/specializations/interaction-design](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/interaction-design)\n3. [https://www.coursera.org/specializations/user-interface-design#courses](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/user-interface-design#courses)\n\nBasically I took an overview course (wish this google one was available when I was learning!), then a more specialized interaction design course, then a UI course. \n\nAfter that I took a variety of courses through [https://www.interaction-design.org/](https://www.interaction-design.org/). I really liked the format of these and the content. Kind of hate the sign up and how you have to wait to take certain things as classes fill up, but the content was and still is great. \n\nThen I signed up for my local community colleges and took a couple graphic design courses and an Intro to UX class. Luckily they offered a couple more UX classes, so I think I took 2 more in total. I honestly think this could be skipped, wasn't different from what I learned online and hated being so ahead of the other students tbh. The only good thing was I got 5k a semester from FAFSA, so that helped me survive. May be worth it just for FAFSA honestly.\n\nThen my path becomes kind of blended. I'm signing up for individual classes when I find one that sounds like a new topic to me. I'm constantly creating my own fake projects and redesigning websites during this time. I always had at least 2 side projects going that I was doing outside of any classes or other training. These conceptual projects soon became my first portfolio. \n\nBy this point I've read some books, I've taken a ton of online classes and a couple community college ones and I've now got my first portfolio. So then I signed up for [upwork.com](https://upwork.com) as a freelancer and put my rate at $20 and started applying for contracts. It worked pretty quickly and then I signed with an agency for a year. After that agency, I went to work for Dell. I went from Dell to another huge tech company, to a startup, to a different startup where I'm at now. \n\nI'm now a senior designer and I love design. There are many things I hate about the tech industry but at the end of the day I make a lot of money to do a job that's really fun and honestly not all that hard once you're trained. It's really just repeating a process and being able to brainstorm. \n\nSo I got started late but now I'm on track to retire at 45 with 2.6 million. \n\nThat was basically it. That's how I got from minimum wage to 160k base salary without a college degree, bootcamp, internship, family connections, or networking. After you break in, networking happens naturally and explosively. \n\nI hope this helps someone who may want to follow the same path, we could always always use more designers and it's such a fulfilling and rewarding field to be in. Please let me know if you have any questions. \n\nThanks for reading my story.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Fire", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qx4j", "subreddit_subscribers": 98203, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Here's exactly how I went from making minimum wage to 160k+ in 5 years with no degree", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Fire/comments/ml1wzv/heres_exactly_how_i_went_from_making_minimum_wage/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1617677925.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "allun11", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_15m6aa", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1617283885, "domain": "self.learnprogramming", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/mhvd5e/my_current_journey_to_become_a_selftaught/", "gildings": {}, "id": "mhvd5e", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 17, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/learnprogramming/comments/mhvd5e/my_current_journey_to_become_a_selftaught/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1617283902, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi there,\n\nI started coding in October last year, so around 6 months ago. I've learned a ton in these 6 months and discovered how much I enjoy coding. It took a while to understand all the different areas to learn, and I have searched for hours for good tutorials and resources and crafting a plan for moving toward the goal of becoming a full-stack developer. I though I could share the resources I've learned from and appreciated, for someone being in the same position in the beginning of their coding career. \n\n**Some background on my goals for you to relate on how relevant the study plan is for you**\n\nTaking on the path to becoming a full-stack developer is not something you can just do in a couple of months, but require a long-term commitment. My current is to be able to search for a job when I've got around 14 months of experience (I'm studying around 50 % pace and working the other half)\n\nThe first goal is to master back-end and front-end enough to be able to get a job in web development, and from that I want to develop in the areas of algorithms and AI. I've separated my learning into four sections that build on top of the previous one:\n\n1. Learn basic programming-thinking\n2. Learn practical implementation and tools for web development\n3. Learn needed math and algorithm thinking\n4. Learn practical AI implementation\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**Hope you get some value from this post and best of luck with your coding :)**\n\n# These are the resources that I've used/planning to use in each episode:\n\n**1) Learn basic programming-thinking**\n\nHere I've finished the course CS50x from Harvard, a free course that's one of the best courses I've ever taken (including all the courses leading up to my master degree in business...). It's challenging and you will get a good start on learning to think like a programmer. It took me around 4 months to finish.\n\n[https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0)\n\nFor the final project I maybe overdid it a bit and built an app in NodeJS, where I found a great tutorial by Traversy Media that worked as an inspiration:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBvmnHTQIPY&amp;ab\\_channel=TraversyMedia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBvmnHTQIPY&amp;ab_channel=TraversyMedia)\n\nTo complement the knowledge needed for the final project I took the following two great courses by Anthony Alicea. They are a bit old but still very much valuable.\n\n[https://www.udemy.com/course/understand-javascript/](https://www.udemy.com/course/understand-javascript/)\n\n[https://www.udemy.com/course/understand-nodejs/](https://www.udemy.com/course/understand-nodejs/)\n\n**2) Learn practical implementation and tools for web development**\n\nThe final project from CS50 actually was kind of a bridge over to step 2. After I finished CS50 I continued with CS50 Web development, which I'm currently enrolled in, planning to finish in a couple of months.\n\n[https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-web-programming-python-and-javascript?delta=0](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-web-programming-python-and-javascript?delta=0)\n\nFor the final project I'm planning to build an app in React and Django, I'm currently enrolled in the following course with Stephen Grider which is really good at teaching React:\n\n[https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/)\n\nAnd I'm planning to go through the following tutorial, again with Traversy Media to get an understanding of how to integrate React and Django:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uyei2iDA4Hs&amp;ab\\_channel=TraversyMedia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uyei2iDA4Hs&amp;ab_channel=TraversyMedia)\n\nAfter finishing up to here, and working a bit on my portfolio and developing my personal projects, I believe I can be ready to apply for a full-stack position at a start-up. Not at one of the Big Tech companies (Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc) but that's not really my ambition right now, so that's fine.\n\n**3) Learn needed math and algorithm thinking**\n\nNext step is to get into learning the algorithmic thinking, which was covered a bit in CS50x, but to get much deeper into the subject and really understand it. The following course in discrete mathematics and algorithms I found has been recommended to me on this sub and have really good reviews. I estimate that this full step will take between 9-12 months and will hopefully be done alongside having a job a web developer.\n\n[https://www.coursera.org/specializations/discrete-mathematics](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/discrete-mathematics) \n\n[https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms?aid=true](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms?aid=true) \n\n**4) Learn practical AI implementation**\n\nLearning AI and machine learning to implement the knowledge from step 3. I'm planning to enroll in CS50 AI course which can be found here:\n\n[https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-introduction-artificial-intelligence-python?delta=0](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-introduction-artificial-intelligence-python?delta=0)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "learnprogramming", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r7yd", "subreddit_subscribers": 2137134, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My current journey to become a self-taught full-stack developer [Resources and study plan]", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/mhvd5e/my_current_journey_to_become_a_selftaught/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1617283885.0}]
