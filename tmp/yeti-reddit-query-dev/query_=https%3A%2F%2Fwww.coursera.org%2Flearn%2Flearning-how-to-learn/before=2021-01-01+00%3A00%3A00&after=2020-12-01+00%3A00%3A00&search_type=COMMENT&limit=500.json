Off the top of my head (and I'm not sure if I remember correctly), I recall their advice was:\n\n* The exam is long---be prepared to be exhausted towards the end (especially the \u7f29\u5199 section).\n* Don't subsequently change your answers in the listening section: you most likely remember incorrectly and will get them wrong.\n* The reading speed recommendation was 150 characters per minute, and this is very important (otherwise you simply don't have time to read the questions).  You won't have time to read the articles in full, so instead you should just read the intro and the conclusion, then read the questions and search for the answers---the articles typically have a predictable structure.  Familiarity with Chinese culture and history helps, e.g., famous Chinese historical figures, dynasties, etc.\n* For the essay section, I recall them emphasizing how you should memorize \"who\" \"when\" \"what happens\" \"what are the consequences\" and a few other things like that.  Try not to miss out on key plot points; don't change the content (e.g. add your own opinions).  They also discuss how it's better to keep it simple: when students write to impress the examiner, they make concrete mistakes for which they lose marks.\n\nOther than that, there are HSK6-specific videos like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV0GK_lZ4Iw) which highlight how there will be content outside of the HSK6 vocabulary (and how to overcome that).  Nevertheless, John Pasden's advice in a [*You Can Learn Chinese* podcast](https://youcanlearnchinese.mandarincompanion.com/episodes/39-the-future-of-learning-chinese-Vrahav_u) (\\~56:30) is:\n\n&gt;...people are prepping for the HSK, my advice is always that the single most important thing to do is learn that vocabulary ...\n\nI've seen advice to [skip the \u8bed\u75c5 section altogether](https://chinese.stackexchange.com/q/39715/8099) and save time for the other sections: it's far too hard---I'm not sure if this is good advice, but it is so difficult that [native Chinese speakers can get some of these questions wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADg1BLT7EcI).  So certainly avoid spending too much time on this section.\n\nThe only other thing I want to mention is the existence of the book *21\u5929\u5f81\u670d\u65b0HSK\u516d\u7ea7\u5199\u4f5c*, which is intended as a 3-week course for the \u7f29\u5199 section of the HSK6 exam (with lots of example answers---[I haven't found them elsewhere](https://languagelearning.stackexchange.com/q/4750/2795)).  I bought this book, but haven't gotten around to taking the course yet.  The first week is relatively simple (HSK5 level), and it increases in difficulty.  It expects you to explicitly write down \u65f6\u95f4, \u5730\u70b9, \u4eba\u7269, \u8d77\u56e0, \u7ecf\u8fc7, \u7ed3\u679c for each exercise.

A lot of people swear by methods like [\"the pomodoro technique,\"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) where you set a timer for 25 min (or something similar - perhaps if you're a serious procrastinator, you can work your way up by setting shorter periods of work time, idk) and work that time, then take a few minutes (eg, 5) of a break - rinse and repeat, taking a longer break after certain periods of time have elapsed (eg, after 4 \"pomodoros\"/an hour of \"work\" time, take a 20 min break).\n\nIn addition, spaced repetition is generally a good way to learn, and can really help you get a better handle on a topic as you let it percolate through the brain. Taking a break on problems can help give you that \"ah-ha!\" moment when you take another crack at it.\n\nBut tldr is: you stop procrastination through practice and breaking tasks up, which can allow you to be more efficient when you are actually working on a task as well as understand something better.\n\nAlso note! Apparently pain pathways are lit up in your brain when you start to do something you don't want to do as a serious procrastinator,  but its been found that this goes away quickly once you're working in a task for a little bit. So... the discomfort is real... but it goes away/only lasts while you anticipate doing the thing you want to do.\n\nI may be generalizing that too much - [here's](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0048076) a study about it, specifically regarding anticipation of math work. \n\nMy source for this is a book [*A Mind for Numbers*](https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Numbers-Science-Flunked-Algebra-ebook/dp/B00G3L19ZU) that goes over learning techniques, but there's also a book by the same person with an additional author called [*Learning How to Learn*](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-How-Learn-Spending-Studying/dp/0143132547) (and a [coursea course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) by the same name) which may be useful resources.

So as I understand your question:\n\nYou would like to find an internship, however you are concerned about what you could possibly contribute to an experienced CPA practice. Also, you are wondering how you would communicate with them and sell yourself as a potential employee or intern.\n\nAnd here is my perspective:\n\nThe CPA office would determine how you could help. In general it'll be grunt level work. Copying, clerk stuff, sorting, greeting clients. Things like that. But by being at the office you can push yourself to try and help with more value added work. Perhaps even do some research for the CPA if asked. Or you might even do some research on your own for something you know that they haven't researched yet and give them a report on your own time with links to the rules and websites and all that. (For example, say there was a new rule that just came out or that a client is doing something that impacts them in another state that the CPA hadn't worked with before, you could research the information on your own and provide a report in email with website links on where the CPA can find the information to do their own analysis. This saves them time and it allows you to learn how to do something and it gives you feedback on what you're doing. Or you might learn how to do Excel and help them with some bookkeeping work. A reconciliation if they feel comfortable with you. Things like that which an evolve over time as they begin to trust you and you show you can do those things. (By the way, this isn't normal for the average college student but there is nothing to say you can't do it. Just don't he arrogant. LeBron and Kobe went straight to the NBA. There is not rule that an 18 year old can't do Excel reconciliations or tax research)\n\nAs for how to get a job or internship: A letter written directly to CPA practices in your local area asking for an internship, opportunity to work, or informational interview could work. (Research each CPA you write to and include a note specific to them in one line or paragraph.) I would put together a form letter about yourself. That you are a local student and want to gain practical experience while in school. That you are passionate about accounting and are motivated to learn as much as you can. That you work hard and are willing to do what is necessary to contribute. That you would love to either work for them part time, intern, or do an informational interview. (Even if you get a job, I would still try to do an informational interview with them. I would also formally thank them and also send them a holiday card every year or birthday greeting to keep in touch. Or some sort of update on your career with a note on how they helped you and thanking them. Things like that to keep the relationship and network.)\n\nInclude a resume or bio in your letter. It doesn't have to be a formal resume but just highlights on you. What you're doing. Interested in. Etc. \n\nSend both the resume and letter l to your professor beforehand and ask for his or her feedback or advice. Make sure to try and make it easy to read. Make it well organized. Use bullet points and bold. Get feedback from business writing expert you know...or something like that. And try to make the letter no more than a 5 minute read...and something that can be skimmed over quick in a minute if necessary. Like say if you wrote a letter that could be read in 5 minutes...maybe bold some of the key words that get to the point. College student. Love accounting. Work part-time or internship. Informational interview. (Also build relationships with other professors you can find.)\n\nIf you can find a person that knows someone that works in accounting do an informational interview with them. If you know someone at the CPA practice then reference them in your note or letter...or if you know someone that knows someone....etc \n\nExpand to other places you can work. Perhaps the college has an accounting department you can help work at part time. Perhaps a local bookkeeper needs help.\n\nAs for what you can do at a CPA office. Filing. Copying. Receptionist. Coffee. You might be able to research for them (Like research something obscure that they haven't got to yet and then give it to them in a summary form as you understand it with links so that they save time)\n\nYou are not going to be the one to make a decision on the treatment (that is up to the CPA to determine), but if you can save the CPA hours of research during a busy season that is valuable. And obviously it is valuable to you because you learn things at a higher level. (Also, before you give the research to the CPA you can go to a place like r/accounting, r/tax, r/taxpros, r/bookkeeping, etc to either research the question or ask others if your understanding is correct. (This will provide additional confidence to yourself that what you are providing is value added...but remember you're the student and they are the teacher...and even if you believe they may misunderstand something it's not your decision. They have the credential and it's their license and they have others in their personal network they rely on and they know the specifics of the situation with the client.)\n\nRemember in sales each 'no' gets you one step closer to a 'yes'. And all you need is one 'yes' to get a job or internship at a company.\n\n\nAs for business and investing, I would focus more on really diving deep into accounting. Maybe read something like Accounting For Dummies. Read those books and websites I referenced. While investing and business are tangential, what guy really need to learn is accounting. Both the theory and practice. You might even watch lectures on accounting or take an online class on the side for fun at Coursea. I believe they are still free (It's a way to learn from top institutions while you are doing other things and move ahead on the learning curve while you have free time)\n\nUPenn is a top school...lots of wealthy students and successful students. \n\nhttps://www.coursera.org/specializations/finance-accounting\n\nIllinois is probably fine as well \n\nhttps://www.coursera.org/specializations/accounting-fundamentals\n\nSpend time taking Coursea courses on the side when you're not busy with other stuff. (In my mind you should try to get to the point where you're ahead of the other students in class because you are so comfortable with the meterial that you can work ahead and learn new concepts)\n\nWhile investing is tangential to accounting, it is not accounting (It is something that you can learn in the future after school pretty easily or taking classes at uper division levels at University). The same goes for 'business.' The better you learn accounting and more quickly the better opportunities that come along because people will understand that you can speak intelligently on the subject and understand a lot of concepts / rules.\n\nOkay...well that's a lot. Sorry it isn't organized...but I had to put this down and pick it up a couple of times.\n\nP.S. - Here is a link to another comment I made with additional links in it.

This is my uni's page: https://www.coursera.org/ucdavis \nThere's also other cheap alternatives to learn data science, but it can be overwhelming because there's a handful of software and programming languages that are used (R, SQL, Python, Tableau, etc.)\n\nI don't want to make this too long so PM me if you want more info from me or add me on discord at linttastic #5456 :) :)", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1608001991, "gildings": {}, "id": "gfvtwvu", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_kceyfk", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_gfv2may", "permalink": "/r/dragonage/comments/kceyfk/update_the_extensive_da_demographics_and/gfvtwvu/", "retrieved_on": 1608007159, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "dragonage", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r8lo", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1608001991.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "Iliekscience", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1ufv8dzr", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1607977124, "gildings": {}, "id": "gfuhq6k", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_k9jpp8", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_gfo8e69", "permalink": "/r/IWantToLearn/comments/k9jpp8/iwtl_how_to_study_properly/gfuhq6k/", "retrieved_on": 1607980885, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1607977124.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "uponacliff", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_11t0np", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "If I had to pick one, I'd say a free course about wellbeing from Yale University.

(Coursera)  \n[Improving Your Statistical Questions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/improving-statistical-questions) (Coursera)\n\nI loved [Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/) and the PDF is free. There are also free videos that go with each chapter. This is like the bible of basic stats and will PROPERLY teach you general linear models (GLMs) and how to do them in R. You may have learned correlations, t-tests, and ANOVAs as if they were all different things: they're not. They're all GLMs and they're all fundamentally correlations.  \nThat book has more advanced stuff after, but you don't necessarily need to learn the later stuff. It's there if you want to expand into it.\n\nThat book unfortunately doesn't cover multilevel-modelling, though, which is a more advanced form of GLM that takes account of \"nested\" data. The classic example is students nested in classes nested in schools nested in school-districts: the fact that a bunch of data-points (students) all share a common classroom is ignored in basic GLMs but multilevel-modelling accounts for that. It's easy once you know how to do GLMs and it's just a different line of R code. It's also the standard basic modelling you'd expect to see (typically participants are modelled as \"random effects\", which means multilevel modelling).\n\nAlso, for R. you might start out uncomfortable with coding, but that's life: you gotta push through ignorance to learn. There are plenty of free introductory courses to learn R and this is one skill that will translate even if you pursue other things. Just search Coursera for \"Data Science\"; I used the Johns Hopkins ones. That will get you up to speed with the basics of R.\n\nIf you bounce off the first book, check out [Andy Field's \"Discovering Statistics\"](https://www.discoveringstatistics.com/about/). It's the other main \"bible\" of stats praised by many. I've not used it since I went with the one I linked above (ISL).

Also it\u2019s important to experiment with your own recopies, just do what you like! Want banana flavoured pancakes? Sure! Raspberry bread? Go for it! Remember, there are hundreds upon hundreds of things for you to use so keep experimenting until you find something you like!\n\nStep 2: actual business stuff, again business is important and I\u2019m not really qualified to give advice here so I\u2019ll just link stuff instead.\n\nLinks:\n\nUCLA website with resources:  [UCLA Stuff](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/departments-and-centres/centres/ucl-centre-educational-leadership/free-online-learning-resources)\n\nStarter high: [starter high](https://starterhigh.brianhamilton.org/)\n\needi.com, more just general maths related stuff, not really anything terribly specific to business but just in case: [Maths Stuffs](https://eedi.com/blog/covid-19-school-closures-free-maths-support-resources-and-ideas)\n\nCoursera: [coursers](https://www.coursera.org/campus/basic/?utm_medium=sem&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=C4C-c4cb-google-Brand-Search-EMEA-Exact&amp;utm_content=3q&amp;utm_term=20free-online-learning&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIzJXZn8O67QIVELrtCh2b-QYzEAAYASAAEgJZFvD_BwE)\n\nMore specific coursera: [business coursera](https://www.coursera.org/business/homepage?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIg_z30cO67QIVZLR3Ch2kIAdMEAAYASAAEgIub_D_BwE#form/?utm_medium=sem&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=C4B-Google-Brand-Search-EMEA-BMM&amp;utm_content=3q&amp;utm_term=free-online-learning)\n\nStep 3:???, okay not really of course you\u2019ll need to start a business and do a bunch of business stuff, but I think it is important, at least at the beginning, to have a second source of income just in case. Also having a chat with family and friends is important! They might be able to give advice that I can\u2019t. Talk to teachers, see if you can start taking business classes or your countries equivalent of home economics.

Aim for the long-term.\n* Spend as little as you can, save the more you can, make the most you can. This is the biggest factor you can influence to reach your financial outcomes.\n* Don't stop studying finance. There's always more you can learn, regardless of your path in life.\n* Money solves your problems only up to a point, and brings other problems. When you have the money, how are you gonna store it? How are you gonna avoid losing it? How are you gonna make more of it? How are you gonna do taxes? How are you gonna spend it?\n* Make sure, that you have a great understanding about inflation, interest and compound interest. This alone can change your financial life.\n\n**In general, you can follow this path:**\n\n1. Reduce debt - pay off high-interest debt (&gt; 5%) as fast as possible\n2. Cashflow and basic needs - food, house, etc. Start working the highest paying job you can the earliest you can. Studying counts.\n3. Get some financial safety - SAVE MONEY. Build an emergency fund (\\~6 months of your monthly expenses).\n4. Start accumulating wealth - Build an investment portfolio. Start saving for retirement. Reduce debt - seems easy but gets very hard between 20-30 and is a pivotal moment for your financial life.\n5. Work towards financial freedom - Long-term investments, retirement planning, children education, vacations.\n\nIt sounds basic, because it is, most people stop at 1 and stay there.\n\n**How to learn about investing**\n\n* Investopedia [has a great 101](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/11/3-s-simple-investing.asp)\n* Khan academy [has great deep dives and didactic content](https://www.khanacademy.org/college-careers-more/personal-finance/pf-investment-vehicles-insurance-and-retirement)\n* Stanford has a great overview of all 5 items in [CS007: Personal finance for engineers](https://cs007.blog/)\n* Rich dad poor dad - easy way to learn the mindset\n* When you feel confident you know how things work, read the intelligent investor by Benjamin Graham and keep reading until you get it. This book is important even if you don't agree with it.\n* When you understand the book, it's time to get you ready for solid investing, for that you can do a great, free, online course from [NYU: Investment Philosophies](http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/New_Home_Page/webcastinvphil.htm).\n* If you actually like what you're learning or have the knack for it, there's a great course from [Yale university, available for free: Financial markets.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/financial-markets-global#enroll)\n\nGood luck", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1606956898, "gildings": {}, "id": "gefrw6i", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_k5k3sp", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_k5k3sp", "permalink": "/r/InvestmentEducation/comments/k5k3sp/im_a_new_to_investment_i_am_16_years_old_and_i/gefrw6i/", "retrieved_on": 1606965719, "score": 5, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "InvestmentEducation", "subreddit_id": "t5_3442j", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1606956898.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "IWantToLearnBot", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8jb803mb", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Hi, I'm a bot.
