Companies in all industries are beginning to take advantage of the massive increase in data and new big data technologies that can be analyzed and used. This is great hope for those who wish to pursue a high-paying career in an exciting and forward-looking field. But it\u2019s not just those who follow traditional academic paths, such as one of the best data science masters in the United States mentioned in a recent article, who can benefit from it. There are also many free online courses and tutorials. A motivated person can use it as a springboard for a useful and profitable career. So, let\u2019s see **how can you learn data science free online.**\n\n# 9 best ways to learn data science for free\n\n## [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=free%20courses%20data%20science): \u2013\u00a0Data Science Specialization\n\n[Coursera ](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=free%20courses%20data%20science)offers a **data science free online course with certificate**, one of the oldest online data science courses at Johns Hopkins University. It is not completely free, and if you can afford it, you will have to pay for the course and certification fees, but this does not apply to students who are financially not able to pay the fees.\n\nThe majors of these 10 courses cover statistical programming, cluster analysis, natural language processing, and mobile learning applications in R. To complete the project, the students create a data product that can be used to solve real-world problems.\n\n## Coursera: -Data-Driven Decision Making\n\nIn addition, this course in Coursera is hosted by PwC, so it is not surprising that it focuses more on business applications than theory, covering the range of tools and techniques used by companies today to solve data problems, as well as the different roles that data scientists can play. Students are also trained to choose the best tools and frameworks for solving data problems. The 4-week course ends with an assignment that includes the implementation of data solutions in a simulated business environment.\n\n## [EdX](https://www.edx.org/course/subject/data-science): \u2013\u00a0Data Science Essentials\n\nThis course is provided by Microsoft, a data science free\u00a0online course by Harvard University as part of a data science professional program certification, but it can also be studied as a standalone course through EdX. Students should have \u201cintroductory\u201d knowledge of R or Python, the two most popular data science programming languages \u200b\u200btoday. Topics covered include probability and statistics, data mining, visualization, and introduction to automated learning on the Microsoft Azure platform. Although all course materials are free, students can pay for an official certificate (in this case $90) after graduation.\n\n## [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-data-science--ud359): \u2013 Introduction to Machine Learning\n\nThere is not a single doubt that machine learning is one of the most trending topics in data science at the present moment. This course aims to provide a comprehensive overview from theory to practical applications and introduces the selection of data sources and the selection of algorithms that are most suitable for specific problems. \u2026This course is also part of the paid \u201cNano Degree\u201d in Udacity Data Analysis.\n\n## [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/training/badge/fb3af6d8-2402-4acb-b852-7a0c5034c976): \u2013\u00a0Data Science Fundamentals\n\nIBM offers a series of free online courses on its website (formerly Big Data University, now Cognitive Classroom). The program includes Data Science 101, methodology, practical applications, R programming, and open-source tools. About 20 hours, although people with computer experience may recover faster, and beginners may take longer.\n\n## [California Institute of Technology: \u2013](https://work.caltech.edu/telecourse) Learning from Data\n\nThis machine learning course is a set of video lectures with assignments and final examination. In addition to outlining how computers \u201clearn\u201d, you will also study mathematics in depth (hope that students have a practical understanding of matrices and calculus, so this is not suitable for aspiring mathematicians).\n\n## [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/): \u2013 Become a Data Scientist\n\nIt is an independent online training provider, and unlike most other universities, it is not affiliated with any university. They provide free access to most course materials, but you can also pay for quality services including supervising projects. It offers mainly 3 paths, data analyst, data scientist, and data engineer-with the support of Uber, Amazon, and Spotify, this seems to be a good way to see if you can learn data science without spending a penny.\n\n## [KDNuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2021/01/learn-data-science-free-2021.html): \u2013\u00a0Data Mining Course\n\nThey have developed many free data mining courses as it is well-known for business and data science websites. There are many modules available for machine learning and statistical concepts such as decision-making trees, regression, classification, and an introduction to the actual technical implementation.\n\n## The Open: \u2013 Source Data Science Masters\n\nThis course is not provided by any organization or institution but is composed of a series of open-source materials and resources that are freely available on the Internet. Topics covered include Twitter\u2019s natural language API processing using Python, Hadoop MapReduce, SQL and NoSQL databases, and data visualization. It also includes the basics of algebra and statistics needed to understand the basics of data science. Of course, there is no certification, but the program can be done at your own pace, which is a good introduction to the wealth of data science.

But I think having another person with me would give a little bit of social pressure to get things done and make me more efficient (or not? but it's worth a shot).\n\nA huge requirement is you need to speak either English or Malayalam. And I want a work first, friends later, type relationship. Our primary purpose should be to get things done, but if we have great chemistry or something, we can be friends or something else. And I would prefer to have someone around a similar age (I just don't want to adjust my social etiquette to older people).\n\nOh yeah so what can we do together?\n\nIf you have a drawing tablet we can do a digital art course together: [https://www.ctrlpaint.com/](https://www.ctrlpaint.com/)\n\nProgramming is apparently super important these days, and if you little or zero experience in this like me, we can do a python course together to learn some basics: [https://www.coursera.org/learn/learn-to-program](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learn-to-program)\n\nIf you're thinking about writing a fictional world like me, maybe we can go through this wiki together: [https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/wiki/index](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/wiki/index)\n\nWe can learn how to do basic home economics together. Like learning how to cook, clean and maintain the house. Even at this age I still don't know how to do these things. We can cook stuff together lol and share what we made together.\n\nWe can even be all meta, and learn how to maintain communication with each other, and not ghost each other after a week. Maybe we can use discor? Still a boomer when it comes to discor.\n\nIf in some timeline there are a lot of people responding to this, and I'm unable to respond back, feel free to hijack this post and find someone amongst

"retrieved_on": 1623951569, "score": 26, "selftext": "From figuring out if I actually wanted SRS (Sex Reassignment Surgery), to researching, hair removal and so much much there are many steps involved before having this surgery.\n\nThis is one entry in a series of posts drawn out of notes and journal entries.  A link to all of the posts can be found in [my transition journey](https://www.reddit.com/user/2d4d_data/comments/axeax8/my_mtf_transition_story_series).\n\nAs with all my posts, this is comprised of notes from my journey, from someone that knew something was off since childhood and transitioned well past puberty had done its thing. Your journey will be different, YMMV applies to this community more than most, and there is no right or wrong way.\n\n\n# Meta\n\nThere is a lack of medical research on this topic and there are many opinions.  I have tried to remove my own opinions, but I would not be surprised to learn that something I wrote was incorrect or outdated.  I recommend taking time to learn and making your own choices beyond what I have written.\n\n\n# Deciding that you want SRS\n\nIt took several years to decide that having SRS was right for me and was a journey all on its own.  This story is in its own post: [Deciding SRS was right for me](https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/imd0eq/deciding_srs_was_right_for_me/)\n\nBeing informed, taking your time, and making sure that this is what you want is never a wrong thing.\n\n\n# Speed\n\nEverything about SRS is slow.\n\nOnce I finally decided to have SRS there are all sorts of steps that slow you down.  Different surgeons have different hair removal requirements, but you need consultations (which have their own wait time) to decide where you are going.  Consultations can require therapist letter(s).  If you do need hair removal, getting the prior authorization from insurance, if covered, can take a long time and the hair removal process itself is 1-2 years.  The surgery itself isn't cheap so if you need to save up even if insurance covers it.  If you need to lose weight that can take a long time too.  After all that you still need to book the actual surgery which can have a multi-year waitlist.  And when you do have surgery, the recovery is long.\n\nWhen you are at the start and finally say, \"Yes this is what I want!\" it can be depressing knowing that it can be years away.\n\n## Catch 22\n\nYou can't get all the information to decide where to have SRS without having consultations.  Consultations can take months and they assume you are having the consultation because you have already chosen them.\n\nI love Insert_Witty_Words [rant](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/aage8m/going_crazy_trying_to_figure_out_which_surgeon_i/) on this.\n\n\n## Cancelations\n\nDoing as much as possible before your consultations will help speed up the whole process.  If you are all set it is common to book a date that was a cancelation and is only weeks or months away rather than years.\n\n\n# Separating SRS from your transition\n\nSeparating SRS from your social transition and seeing SRS as a medical event has many positive benefits.\n\n * While I could be disappointed at the inevitable delays, I would not be crushed.\n * I will be pickier about what surgeon I go to.\n * I will be more likely choose to do what is right for me rather than what I can get done fast.\n * If a good opportunity comes up elsewhere in my life I will be able to take advantage of it and put off SRS for a little while.\n * It gives me permission to say I want to wait a few years to see how techniques or surgeons improve or because I am not 100% sure.\n * I am giving myself permission to say no I don't want this without tying it to my transition and conversely when I say yes, I know it is what I want.\n * I won't be putting my life on hold until this happens.\n\nIt is common to not work on the rest of your life while transitioning, treating SRS as the final event, and then getting depressed when you realize that your life is not magically better after.  You need to work on everything else in your life, delaying that while waiting for surgery can be unhealthy.\n\n\n# Which type of surgery?\n\nThe first thing to decide is what major type of surgery you are looking for.  For a comprehensive list, details as well as who does what checkout the [Transgender_Surgeries wiki section on types of surgery](\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/introduction#wiki_types_of_surgery).\n\nUntil you make a choice, all options are still available.  They will be there next month and next year.  The same surgeons will be around, happy and ready to take your money.\n\nIt is okay to take your time answering these questions.  Your answers can change for many reasons including how you see yourself, changes in sexuality, and your confidence.  My answer did.\n\n## Orchiectomy\n\nI wasn't going to cover all the options, but given the amount of misinformation I have seen about orchiectomy I want to talk about it.\n\nWhat is it?\n\n&gt; Removal of the testicles\n\nOrchiectomy can be done in several different ways.  See the [Wikipedia page on Orchiectomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchiectomy) for a full overview of the types as well as full details on each procedure.\n\nOrchiectomy is an uncomplicated and short procedure.  It is done all over the place because cis men with cancer also have it done.  You leave the hospital the same day you had this done.  I had a consult with a surgeon at my local hospital 15 minutes away.  An example of how simple this is; he would prefer I get knocked out for the procedure, but we talked about using local anesthetic instead.  Even though this is simple, like any surgery a bad infection can result in a very long stay at the hospital.\n\nThis procedure removes both testicles which is where the majority of \"the bulge\" comes from.  If being able to wear clothes with less worrying is what you need, this might be a good option.  If looking in the mirror and having an improved profile other than the penis, this might be a good option.\n\nIf you are having this done before starting HRT because your testicles are big and that is uncomfortable, it is important to know that they atrophy over the first year and become a fraction of their previous size.  They are still there, but if \"being there\" was a huge sense of dysphoria this can be diminished somewhat over time.\n\nCis men need their testicles to be on the outside of their body.  If they are undescended they have an increased risk of testicular cancer.  That being said, the testicles of trans women on HRT are not like cis men's, nor are the testicles of those with CAIS, and on r/intersex the current view seems to be against removal of the undescended testicles.  I asked a surgeon, but they said they would not move mine into my abdomen.\n\nIf you are having this done so you don't have to take an AA, monotheropy exist and you want to explore that option because it isn't surgery.\n\nYou can still get hard after an Orchiectomy.  Testicles and the Testosterone they produce is not a prerequisite for getting hard.  If that was the case Viagra, Cialis, etc would contain Testosterone which they don't.\n\nRemoving the testicles will change your hormone levels which can change your libido.  You might want to supplement with topical Testosterone to raise your Testosterone levels to cis female levels after.\n\nIf you are not considering a vaginoplasty **ever** there are options such as [orchiectomy with a labiaplasty](https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/b9v8rg/pioneering_a_new_transgender_surgery_option/exfb3p5) or a scrotectomy to remove all the skin.  If you are not sure, you could get an orchiectomy and several years later a scrotectomy or labiaplasty with the remaining skin once you are absolutely sure.\n\nIt is common to get an Orchiectomy and then later get a Vaginoplasty.  A select few surgeons won't operate on you if you have had an Orchiectomy.  Beware that this also makes hair removal more difficult and can reduce elasticity.  If the surgeon you are going to does not use the scrotum material to extend the internal vagina this matters less.\n\nAn Orchiectomy removes the Tunica vaginalis peritoneal tissue which some surgeons use these days to line the back of the vagina rather than scrotal skin.  This technique is becoming more common because this tissue will never grow hair.\n\nDon't get an Orchiectomy for the wrong reason.\n\n\n# Learning\n\nConsultations with surgeons go much better if you understand what is involved and how SRS is performed.\n\nFor a fun, very well done video of everything involved in SRS checkout [101 Things To Expect From Vaginoplasty (GCS/GRS/SRS)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDOtejnYWAU)\n\nThe [classification of the anatomical variation in female external genitalia](http://gynodiversity.com/uploads/Classification_of_the_anatomical_variation_in_female_external_genitalia.pdf) is a great resource to learn about the variation that cis women have and what is the name of everything.\n\nFor a complete start to finish guild covering every topic checkout the OHSU [Vaginoplasty booklet](https://www.ohsu.edu/sites/default/files/2020-12/Vaginoplasty-Information-Guide-Dec-9-2020.pdf) (If the link is dead I found it on their [Gender affirming surgery feminizing options page](https://www.ohsu.edu/transgender-health/gender-affirming-surgery-feminizing-options)).  No matter where you end up going I still recommend checking this document out.  It includes stuff that I have not seen elsewhere and in detail that I have not seen elsewhere.\n\nThe book \"Come as You Are: The Surprising New Science that Will Transform Your Sex Life\" has a detailed chapter all about genital development.  Also given how much sex is a component of SRS and how our sexuality often changes from transitioning, the rest of the book is also worth reading.\n\nThis one photo showing how [the labia minora is the penile urethra](https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/ek1a61/proof_about_labia_minora_being_penile_urethra) really helps visualize what is going on.\n\nThis post and its larger number of diverse, but common responses on [common SRS questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/i29xy8/11_questions_for_post_srs_women_im_very/).\n\nThere are videos of actual surgeries up online you can watch.  I won't lie, the first few times watching them was pretty horrifying.  Little by little as I learned the different techniques and had a deeper understanding of what they were doing and could even critique the techniques used.\n\nThere are many presentations by surgeons online, one to start with from a surgeon in Thailand on [Neovagina care](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN-NVge8XmY) which goes over different techniques and [Dr. Avanessian at Mount Sinai](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/transgender-medicine/video-for-module-10-jxcup).\n\nThere are of course many medical articles you can read.  [Dr. Suporn](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31582028) is very interesting all by itself and [Transgender vaginoplasty: techniques and outcomes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6626315/) is a good review of current techniques.\n\nThere isn't one way that this operation is performed.  There are several major different ways most surgeons perform this surgery.  Even if two surgeons say they perform a penile inversion there are a dozen main variations and each has their own way unique way that they accomplish the result.  Any good surgeon will themselves have several different methods depending on the individual and what they have to work with.  Lastly, surgeons are improving their techniques.  A photo or result from a year ago might be something the surgeon doesn't do anymore.\n\nThere is a lot of information you can learn on this topic.  Perhaps I didn't need to translate Russian medical papers on the davydov technique or try to observe a surgery (with covid that never was able to happen).  Somewhere between reading this post and where I went is what you want to do.\n\nPay attention to the possible complications, some can even result in you having more surgeries.  Necrosis, incontinence, and fistula are all possible for example.  Learning how complications are dealt with set my mind at ease if I were to ever have one.\n\n## Timelines\n\nFor a few in-depth written timeline of their experience checkout\n\n*  [ImHereSoIDntGetFound SRS series](https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/b3gy1r/index_for_my_blogs_about_srs_in_january_2019_with/)\n*  [jannaw996 SRS Series](https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/m4ia2x/had_pptppv_with_dr_heidi_wittenberg_march_9th_2021/)\n*  [jasmine1106 SRS Story](https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/hod9fm/my_sas_journey_a_sexpositive_dysphoria_and/)\n* [Aura's before, during and after SRS document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iVz1N4qhnalp1slV_cOijgn5-M3EO3PViTaeL-akMhM/edit#)\n* [mresqueek SRS Information post](https://mresqueek.wordpress.com/srs/)\n[Detailed log of from someone who went to Wittenberg](https://mygenderconfirmation.wordpress.com/blog-2/)\n\nFor an in-depth video timeline of their experience checkout\n\n * [Jamie Mackenzie SRS series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hinS3cXz5OU&amp;list=PLC_IQ1d6wAZdRTwVoBzXw3iGs2-VwrALF)\n\n## Revisions\n\nMost are happy with their initial result and don't go back for a revision, but **more than 30% of people get revisions**.  Beyond the 30% there are those who say they would do something, but are okay with what they have and don't care to go through the hassle.  Surgeons like Dr. McGinn and Dr. Suporn include it with the cost because it is so common and expected.\n\nThe most common areas of revision are removal of excess erectile tissue from within the labia majora, better defining the clitoral hood and labia minora, removing tissue around the urethral opening, and construction of a posterior commissure.\n\nThe erectile tissue is often an aesthetic choice.  Some like having labia majora with a bit of \"bulk\" in them, that also swell in response to sexual stimulation like cis women. (As opposed to \"flat\", \"deflated\", or \"young\" looking labia.) Other girls would prefer they get that reduced.\n\nThe labia minora and clitoral hood are delicate immediately post-op, and they can heal in hard-to-predict ways.  They'll sometimes heal with strange creases or folds that can be corrected.  The tissue around the urethra almost always protrudes after the first surgery.  This is because removing too much of the urethra during the initial surgery makes it much more likely to swell closed during recovery, forcing the patient to be re-catheterized. They can remove the excess in the revision.\n\nIt's very difficult to construct a posterior commissure during a single stage surgery.  It is a very fragile structure that very often results in dehiscence when dilating so it is often saved for the revision.\n\n## Photos\n\nHow the results look at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year are night and day different.  Swelling changes dramatically over the first 6 months and scaring is red for around eight months.  If you only see photos shortly after surgery, you are not seeing the end result.  And if they have a revision it is another 6+ months waiting for that swelling to go down to see the real final result.\n\n\n# Not CIS\n\nSRS isn't some magical surgery.  **The techniques today can give you a vulva and vagina, but it won't result in you having a cis female vagina both the good and bad.**  Nerves have to be cut.  The clit is made from the gland of the penis and won't extend inside and around the vagina.  There is no way to have your vagina self lubricate when aroused (PPT is self lubricating 24/7).  Dilation is required no matter the technique especially at the start and ongoing for life.  A few might have the external scars disappear, but not all.  And that is all with the best outcome.\n\nThere are plenty that have poor results and unfortunately, there are some surgeons who have a high rate of complaints.  There are inexperienced surgeons who are still learning.  This is less the luck of the draw and more about skill and knowledge.\n\nMany women never look at themselves in a mirror.  I expect I will hyper analyze what my results look like and criticize everything.  I have looked at so many vulva's the last few years I can pick out SRS results, sometimes even which surgeon did it, as well as point out what could be done in a revision.  Did I ask for this amount of knowledge?  No, but here we are.  I will try my best to not criticize myself.\n\nIf you are jumping into SRS with very little knowledge with very high expectations you will be disappointed.  The two letters from the therapists are not there to be gatekeeping, but are there for you to talk through what is involved and what you will get.  Spending two years doing hair removal further gave me time to learn as well as confirm (over and over) if this is what I want.\n\nTo repeat what I talked about before, a common thing that is noticed is how in photos the labia minor doesn't wrap around the entrance to the vagina (the posterior commissure).  This is common with single stage vaginoplasties.  Extending the labia minora to the bottom of the vulva often won't hold up with the heavy dilation needed in early recovery and this has to be done at the second stage / revision.  Most photos are taken after the first stage and not everyone gets a revision so this question comes up often.  This question also ignores the fact that this is in fact not outside the realm of normal vulva's.\n\nOnce I let go of that idea that it can't be cis then it was almost fun considering all of the various off menu options or different techniques even if I would dismiss most of them.  Rather than evaluating the different techniques against how close they are to a natural vagina, you can evaluate them as they are with what they offer and don't offer which might be better or worse than a cis vagina.  You can always ask a surgeon to do a slight modification to their normal technique.  The worst they can say is no.  After learning so much about the anatomy I asked for a half dozen tweaks, tweaks that no cis woman has.  Given the variation between surgeons and the pre-op starting place, even without tweaks, every SRS result will be unique.\n\n\n## Lubrication\n\nCheckout [The Myth Behind the Self Lubricating Vagina](https://drzphd.com/transgender/nonbinary/trans-women-the-myth-behind-self-lubricating-vagina)\n\ntl;dr\n\n&gt; Will I be able to have sex without needing lube?\n\nThere is no surgery that will guarantee that you won't need to add lubrication.  Depending on your body and the type of surgery you might be moist, but no surgery can give you a sexual response and you will almost always want to add lube.\n\n\n## Dilation\n\nAll current techniques require dilation.  You can debate the amount of time, the number of times a day, for how many months, and if sex counts, but you have to dilate.  There is much more on this topic, from a pre-op perspective it is important to simply understand that yes, you will need to.\n\nu/Amy_co106 explained why best:\n\n&gt; Effectiveness is most important. Frequent, but ineffective dilation is pointless.  Long duration but ineffective dilation is pointless.\n\n&gt; Immediately post op until healing has taken place, the purpose is to break up scar tissue and keep it in a healing state for longer.  This is supposed to stop the formation of hard areas of scar tissue. If you don't dilate hard enough to do this, you're not achieving anything.  It will hurt.\n\n&gt; In the medium to long term, the purpose is to maintain the neovagina from being followed by things like pelvic floor muscles closing up and the body's other tissues reoccupying the space. If you are not dilating firmly enough to be stretching out those pelvic floor muscles and opening up the space, then you're not achieving anything.\n\n## Hair removal process\n\nEvery single surgeon is okay with you getting at least some hair removal.  Removing all hair before surgery will take a year+ if you do it continuously no matter how small the area is to clear because of hair cycles.\n\nI put together a comprehensive post on [Hair removal information for SRS](https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/nre1km/hair_removal_information_for_mtf_srs/).\n\n\n## Sensation\n\nWhen the gland is turned into the clitoris the nerve bundle that runs up the penis is removed from the penis.  This means that all nerves in the skin of the penis are cut.  These nerves will hopefully reconnect with the nerves where they are attached (the thigh nerves), but a bunch of your vulva is going to be numb for a long time (months to several years), potentially forever.\n\nThe clitoris is created out of a section of the gland of the penis.  It is not the frenulum, but the opposite side where the nerve bundle connects to the gland.  Fun fact: the frenulum is so sensitive because the nerves branch out from the nerve bundle on the other side and meet up on the other side which makes it twice as sensitive as other areas.  These fun sensitive nerves are all cut.\n\nThe long and the short of it is you will have skin that is numb potentially forever and achieving clitoral orgasms can be harder to do, but should be still possible.\n\n\n# Regret\n\nAre you having SRS because it is expected of you?  Because it is the \"final step\"?  Do you feel that therapist letters are only gatekeeping to get through?  Do you think you will be able to stop dilating after a few weeks?  Do you think your scars will disappear and no one will be able to tell?  Are you only doing it to make dating easier and not because you want it?  Are you rushing into this?\n\nTake time to read through some [SRS regrets stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/e5de09/srs_regrets/).\n\nA lot of common regrets include:\n\n * They felt they had to do this as the \"next step\" even if they were not sure\n * They were pressured into having SRS\n * Others told them that this would help them \"pass\"\n * They expect a 100% cis vulva/vagina\n * They were not aware of key details of the surgery.  Such as how long recovery is, how much they would have to dilate, how much can be numb, or how much harder orgasms would be to achieve.\n * Having SRS with an inexperienced surgeon or one who frequently has complications.\n * Getting the wrong surgery, such as getting zero depth when they realize after the fact they actually want depth.\n * Dealing with one or more major complications.\n\nHave SRS for the right reasons and understand what it will give you and what it won't give you.  Becoming well informed, choosing that *you* want to do this, and taking your time can reduce a lot of possible regret you can have.\n\n## Miserable\n\nBack home, dilating and trying to heal post-op when life can be miserable for a while.  There is still swelling, pain, and never ending dilation.  Everything is still healing and minor complications are still being dealt with.  This is often when depression hits.  Anywhere from 3 weeks to four months, but around the two month mark seems common.\n\nA few [example](https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/nl8zd0/my_6_weeks_update_srsppv_in_thailand_dr_kamol/) [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/ntrfsi/dilation_and_postop_depression/) taking about what it is like to be at this point.\n\nThis is miserable enough express thoughts of regret about having the surgery at this point is common.  Going into the surgery you need to know that recovery can be long and hard.\n\n\n# Recovery Timeline\n\nRecovery of SRS isn't a one fits all narrative.  Some people heal really quick while others take a lot longer.  Barring complications the following seems to be a decent gauge of recovery time.\n\n * Orgasm: anywhere from 2 weeks to 1 year.  The further into recovery you are the easier and more enjoyable they are.\n * Back to doing stuff beyond only recovering and dilation: 3-6 weeks\n * 6 weeks is when you are usually cleared for full physical activity\n * Return to work: 6 weeks seems common, but this has been as soon as 3 weeks and as long as 12 weeks.\n * Sex: as recommended, 3 months seems common, a lot more enjoyable later in recovery\n * Majority of the swelling disappears: 4 months\n * Energy returns, back to \"normal life\", between 4-6 months\n * 9-12 months, all better, pain is gone, no discharge, orgasms and sex are better, dilation is down to a manageable level (once a day).\n\n# Therapist letters\n\nEvery surgeon requires therapist letters.  I asked my existing therapist for a recommendation for my 2nd.  Our meetings covered everything that needs to be in the letter as well as a few things I wanted to talk through.  Before booking appointments make sure to check if your insurance requires specific qualifications.\n\nYour insurance might have a list of things the letter must include.  [Dr Christine McGinn's Letter Requirements](https://www.drchristinemcginn.com/services/socrequirements.php) is a good resource of what to include and talk through at the minimum.\n\nDon't look at the letters as gatekeeping.  This is the place for you to figure out for sure that you want to have surgery.  Talk about every possible related aspect that is relevant to you.  Doesn't matter if it isn't required by the letter, if it is relevant to you talk it out.  This can include topics such as sexuality and dating.  Do not be that person that rushed through it and later regrets not taking the time to talk.\n\n\n# Getting your body ready for SRS\n\nFrom the surgeon's perspective, they do not have long-term relationships with you.  They often see you for the first or second time on surgery day and do the best with what you give them.  It is up to you to prepare your body.\n\nYou can do some, all, or none of these.  None of these are quick and some can take years to do.\n\n## Stop Smoking\n\nSmoking can cause issues during and after surgery.  It slows healing, which can cause surgical incisions to be more likely to become infected.  This is serious enough that some surgeons will test you for nicotine.\n\nAnd that pesky lung cancer thing is a good reason to stop too.\n\n## Weight / BMI\n\nBMI isn't a gatekeeping thing.  You will have a better outcome and recovery if you are in a healthy weight range.\n\nHigh BMI is associated with a higher chance of death during surgery.  The wounds on obese people don't stay closed as well and take longer to heal.  Infections are more common and more serious. Anesthesia is more difficult to do, surgeries take longer and so the patient is more at risk due to being under for longer.\n\nWhile you can lose weight only to the upper end of the BMI requirement, being in shape in general will also help with your recovery.\n\nEvery surgeon I investigated had some sort of BMI range requirement for a good reason.  This can also includes needing to gain weight if you are underweight.\n\n## Hair removal\n\nIt is up to you how much you do.  You will live with the consequences, not the surgeon.  Do not put yourself in the stressful position of hoping to finish hair removal before an immovable SRS date.\n\n## Penis skin\n\nFor the first two years of HRT I had had an alarm on my phone that I used to remind myself to get hard twice a week, but then I discovered I could masturbate with a vibrator which was way better.  Unfortunately, the vibrator didn't need me to get hard.  I don't actually know if this was the reason or the continuous low Testosterone in my system, but by 2.5 years erections had become painful and I had lost some length and some girth.  I even got a small tear after one erection from the skin being so tight and thin.  Beyond the pain, this skin is used in SRS so restoring it was important.\n\nI got a prescription for low dose Testosterone that I applied once a week to that skin.  Testosterone causes your skin to thicken.  Within two months the pain had gone away.  Testosterone causes hair growth so there is a balance (and luck) here.  Shortly before surgery, I found two vellus hairs on my upper shaft (which were removed, but still).\n\nI learned that [applying Shea butter can cause skin to becomes thicker, with more collagen](https://www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/research/chemistry/Shea-Butter-Extract-for-Bioactive-Skin-Care-310136331.html). \n\nI also came across a small [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30052192/) which found that applying Witch Hazel topically may help with improving elastic fibers that had UV damage.\n\nI switched to Shea Butter and Witch-hazel daily to get the same results of thicker more elastic skin, but without the risk of hair growth.  I don't know if it is as good as Testosterone, but if I could do it over I would try this first.\n\nTo further help stretch out the skin I got a prescription for Cialis.  The drug has a long half life unlike Viagra and stays in your system for days.  I didn't need it to get hard so this was 100% off label.  With Cialis, I could stay hard longer, as long as I didn't have an orgasm.  Stretching out the skin by getting and staying hard was the goal.\n\nBetween all of the above, my erections no longer were painful anymore and girth/length were restored.\n\n\n## Foreskin Restoration\n\nIf you were circumcised [r/foreskin](r/foreskin_restoration/wiki/index) has a lot of information about how to stretch out your skin to restore it if you want to do that.  The foreskin is often used in creating different skin from the clitoral hood to the labia minora.  Surgeons see patients that have been circumcised and know how to deal with the situation so this isn't required, but it is worth being aware of this.\n\n\n## Scrotal skin\n\nWithin 6 months of starting HRT my testicles were a fraction of the size they were before.  In the years since without the constant weight and size my scrotal skin has shrunk.  I have heard a few surgeons talking about stretching the skin before surgery.  As this skin makes up the end of the vagina having more isn't a bad thing.  Enter (NSFW) r/BallStretching/.\n\nFor me, there isn't anything I could do that would make me more dysphoric than this, but here I was learning about this topic.\n\nThis community has been around for a long time and has a ton of information.  Unlike our community where so many have SRS and disappear, this group sticks around and keeps talking about it (and taking photos).  [The Principle of Skin Expansion](https://www.secretleather.com/jarod-johansens-ball-stretching-guide/introductory/the-principle-of-skin-expansion) is a fantastic resource.  Ignoring ball stretching, reading through everything made me way more confident and less scared in dilation than our scattered anecdotes.  I now have a much better idea of how to recover depth if needed.\n\nBall stretching is sort of like reverse dilation before SRS.  Given I was working from home and other than suffering from the resulting massive dysphoria I saw only the potential upsides of giving my surgeon some more skin to work with.  After the initial period, I could do it 24/7, unlike dilation.  As for hiding the fact I am wearing something, big skirts worked fine.  Even with taking a week off after every electrolysis session for healing, within a few months, I had more skin.\n\nTo deal with the dysphoria in the moment I saw this as an absurd, laughable, \"how did I get here?\" thing I was doing.\n\nEven if you have no interest in getting a weight, it is worth reading how to do [manual stretching in the shower](https://www.secretleather.com/jarod-johansens-ball-stretching-guide/methodology/method1).  This combined with using Shea Butter and Witch-hazel can be used to prepare the skin for surgery.\n\n\n## Prostate orgasm\n\nSome surgeons won't operate on you unless you have had an orgasm of any kind.  For me, figuring out how to have a prostate orgasm relieve the worry that I will never be able to have an orgasm again at all.  If something happens and I have necrosis of the clitoris I know I can still orgasm that way.\n\n\n# Picking a surgeon\n\nYou can find a comprehensive list of [surgeons on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/introduction#wiki_surgeons).\n\nUnfortunately, after doing all your research you can't say something like I want Dr Suporn clitoris, 2nd clitoris, Dr. McGinn's overall vulva and Dr. Ting's hybrid vagina.\n\nThis is where it is important to rank what is important to you.  Sexual sensation, natural vulvar aesthetics, and vaginal depth are the three big ones, but other things such as the amount you are willing to travel, and cost come into play too.  Most surgeons are about the same when things go right.  It is when there are complications you find out how good a surgeon is.\n\nWhat I looked for in a surgeon changed as I learned more.  In the end, someone who has experience producing consistent results, who can help with complications, and who I can go back to for a revision became the most important for me.\n\n\n# Consultation\n\nI decided to go with Dr. McGinn and put my [consultation with Dr. McGinn](https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/kbfybb/srs_consultation_with_dr_mcginn/) in its own post.\n\n## Questions\n\nHere are a few questions you can think about asking at your consultation(s)\n\n * What is their current technique?\n * How has their technique changed over the years?  What's new/changed?\n * Can I see photos?\n * How many have you done?  (look for over 100)\n * Who trained you?\n * How consistent are the results?\n * Complication rates - like inability to orgasm, fistulas, revision frequency, etc.\n * BMI lower and upper limit\n * Which dilator do you create the vagina around?  Why that one? (no they don't all use the orange one)\n * Cost\n * Dates\n\nHair removal\n\n * What do you recommend for hair removal?\n * Would doing more be beneficial?\n * How much hair inside of a vagina do you see?\n * Do you scrape and or cauterize any remaining hair during surgery?\n\nExternal aesthetics\n\n * Where do you place the urethral mucosa in your technique?\n * How will the foreskin be used?\n * How is the hood of the clitoris formed?\n * What is done with the glands of the penis?\n * How are the labia minor/major created?\n * Where do the inner labia end?\n\n\n# Worry\n\nI am the only person I am aware of that had an unlucky and horrifyingly painful experience at Facial Team (great results though!).  This caused a lot of apprehension around the idea of another surgery, one that can have a very painful recovery with lots of complications.  I talked about complications first in all my consultations.  I did a lot of research into SRS which also involved lots of reading around the difficult first six months of dilation, complications and revisions.\n\nAt some point, I took a step back to remind myself why I am doing this.  I am not doing this for the swollen disaster that is one week after surgery, but about how I will be five and ten years from now.  Being able to look down or in the mirror and feeling comfortable with myself rather than ashamed.  Knowing that after everything is healed it won't be some \"foreign thing\", but will be warm, part of me, and sensate.  The idea, the real idea, of relearning about my body including how to orgasm.  Embracing the good and the bad and loving who I will be after this.  When I am overwhelmed or start to worry about complications I now think about this which helps a lot.\n\n\n# The long marathon\n\n * I gave myself a year minimum to decide if I wanted to pursue SRS\n * I scheduled consultations ... for months/years away.\n * I started the paperwork to get prior authorization for genital electrolysis ... only took 9 months\n * I started electrolysis ... which took 20 months.\n * I got a recommendation for a second therapist ... who I saw 7 months later (because covid, but still)\n * I finally booked a surgical date ... 6 months away\n\nBy the time I was booking the surgical date it was actually anticlimactic.  I had been working on this in the background for so long that booking the date was only another step.  Even with a date, it was still more than a half year away with fifty things that needed to get done first.  It wasn't until later when I booked the hotel room that it hit me that this is actually going to happen.\n\n\n# Pre-op\n\nThere is a fair amount to do after you decide on a surgeon and book a surgical date.\n\n## Money\n\nSurgery isn't free.  Maybe you have to pay out of pocket.  Maybe you need to switch insurance plans to cover it.  Maybe you have to pay your insurance max deductible.  Maybe you need to save up for the extra miscellaneous costs associated with doing it.\n\n## Paperwork requirements / Insurance\n\nTherapist letters, maybe an Endocrinologist letter, HIPAA forms, and various smaller things that your insurance and or doctor will require is a bunch of paperwork that is best to do sooner rather than later.\n\n## Buddy forms\n\nEvery surgeon I spoke with required you to have a buddy with you after surgery.  Confirming that someone can actually go and any logistics involved can be a big task.  There are people [that](https://www.t4tcaregiving.org/caregivers.html) [can](\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/bwp5dx/continuing_to_help_after_a_successful_gcssrs_i/?st=jwi5lf5v&amp;sh=f55c0bd0) [help](https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/ajrnn2/offering_my_services_as_a_1_on_1_247_personal).\n\n## Travel\n\nBooking the hotel, flights, car rental, etc.  If you are leaving the country, there can be more paperwork.\n\n## Hair removal\n\nContinue doing electrolysis as needed up until surgery.\n\n## Medical Release\n\nLab work, chest x-ray, physical, and anything else your surgeon requires.\n\n## Work\n\nIf you can take a leave of absence from your job that can have more paperwork to do.  Figuring out who will cover for you, telling your boss you will be out, etc.\n\n## To get/buy/bring\n\nWhat to get breaks down into several groups.  Your surgeon should give you a list and you can find more comprehensive lists from other people on the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSurgeriesWiki/wiki/srs/introduction#wiki_preparing_for_surgery) and many posts such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/j9iio0/srs_surgery_purchase_list_my_experience/)\n\nA basic list:\n\nBefore surgery\n\n * Before surgery liquid diet: Protein drinks, jello, clear chicken soup, etc\n * Magnesium Citrate &amp; fleet enema for the day before\n * Hibiclens Liquid Soap for the night before surgery\n\nAfter surgery / recovery\n\n * Loose clothes such as skirts, dresses or sweatpants\n * Inexpensive underwear that you will eventually toss\n * Donut pillow\n * Grabber for when you don't want to bend down.\n * Surgical gloves\n * Peri bottle\n * Panty liners\n\n * Lozenges, lip balm, water bottle\n * Protein drinks &amp; bars and other nutritious snacks\n * Entertainment\n\nFor dilating\n\n * Handheld mirror\n * Bacteriostatic water soluble lube jelly such as Surgi Lube or KY (~0.25 - 0.33 oz per dilation session)  Try to get something with a [lower ph](https://www.reddit.com/r/Transgender_Surgeries/comments/n8q84q/type_of_lube_matters_a_lot_to_prevent_bv/)\n * Dipper pads, Puppy pads, or similar\n * Baby wipes or washcloths\n\n\n# Luck\n\nYou can spend years researching, doing consultations, choosing the best, preparing, and being very careful after surgery.  You can understand what you are getting and what the complications are and be mentally prepared.  And something doesn't go right.  Every surgeon has results that are good and bad.

My goal is to take at least one of those before this year is over but maybe you have more free time than I do and you're ready to start learning now so here's the list I've made this far in the order that I intend to study;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Cryptocurrency And Blockchain An Introduction To Digital Currency](https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-cryptocurrency-blockchain-introduction-digital-currency) \\-  What is Cryptocurrency and how is it an innovative and effective method of currency? This course was designed for individuals and organizations who want to learn how to navigate investment in cryptocurrencies. Professors Jessica Wachter and Sarah Hammer will guide you through developing a framework for understanding both Cryptocurrency and Blockchain. You\u2019ll learn how to define a currency, analyse the foundations of digital signatures and blockchain technology in cryptocurrency, and accurately assess the risks of cryptocurrency in a modern investment portfolio. By the end of this course, you\u2019ll have a deep understanding of the realities of Cryptocurrency, the intricacies of Blockchain technology, and an effective strategy for incorporating Cryptocurrency into your investment plans. No prerequisites are required, although \"Fintech: Foundations, Payments, and Regulations\"  from Wharton's Fintech Specialization is recommended. \n\n[Blockchain and Money](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/) \\-  This course is for students wishing to explore blockchain technology's potential use\u2014by entrepreneurs and incumbents\u2014to change the world of money and finance. The course begins with a review of Bitcoin and an understanding of the commercial, technical, and public policy fundamentals of blockchain technology, distributed ledgers, and smart contracts. The class then continues on to current and potential blockchain applications in the financial sector.\u00a0 \n\n[Cryptocurrency Engineering And Design](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/media-arts-and-sciences/mas-s62-cryptocurrency-engineering-and-design-spring-2018/#) \\-  Bitcoin and other cryptographic currencies have gained attention over the years as the systems continue to evolve. This course looks at the design of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and how they function in practice, focusing on cryptography, game theory, and network architecture. \n\n[Blockchain and FinTech: Basics, Applications, and Limitations](https://www.edx.org/course/blockchain-and-fintech-basics-applications-and-lim) \\-  Understand the design rationale of blockchain technology, its emerging platforms and applications and uncover the limitations and the opportunities enabled by blockchain applications, particularly as it relates to finance. \n\n[Smart Contracts](https://www.coursera.org/learn/smarter-contracts) \\-  This second course of the Blockchain specialization will help you design, code, deploy and execute a smart contract \u2013 the computational element of the blockchain technology. Smart contracts allow for implementing user-defined operations of arbitrary complexity that are not possible through plain cryptocurrency protocols. They allow users to implement conditions, rules and policies of the domain applications. Smart contracts are a powerful feature that, when properly designed and coded, can result in autonomous, efficient and transparent systems. \n\nYou will design and program smart contracts in Solidity language, test and deploy them in the Remix development environment, and invoke them from a simple web interface that Remix provides. This course features best practices for designing solutions with smart contracts using Solidity and Remix IDE.  Main concepts are delivered through videos, demos and hands-on exercises.\n\n*I hope this helps you in your quest to learn more about the crypto space.*", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false,

92, "selftext": "Over the past 2-3 years, I\u2019ve taken my French from complete beginner (A1) to B2. This has been entirely self-directed, I\u2019ve not taken any classes to do so, and I wasn\u2019t in an area where I was immersed in French. This is how I did it, along with a whole load of the resources I used to get me there. \n\nFor reference, if you don\u2019t know what A1, B2\u2026 means, see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages). I refer to these levels quite a bit.\n\n**Commitment**\n\nIt\u2019s going to take you time. *A lot of time*. You can\u2019t learn a language in a month and anyone who says otherwise is spouting bollocks. The key is consistently learning every day, or close to. You need to build a habit of constant exposure to your language, and that\u2019s the only way to make real progress. There are loads of estimates out there about how many hours total it takes to learn a language. I would guess that I\u2019ve averaged about 30-60 minutes a day. When I spent more time each day, I progressed faster, it\u2019s that simple.\n\n**The Basics**\n\nDuolingo. Everyone loves it. It\u2019s quick, it\u2019s easy, it\u2019s addictive. It\u2019s also shit. *Complete and utter shit.* You won\u2019t get anywhere with it. No matter how much money they spend on advertising, you will not learn a language from duolingo. I found duolingo semi-useful at very introductory levels because it is a way that you can learn vocabulary, but it\u2019s pretty poor for anything beyond that. Once I got to an A2 level, I quickly found that duolingo was a waste of time and that there were more efficient ways to learn. The one thing it does have going for it is that it\u2019s very good at ensuring you stay consistent. What if there was another app that I could use as the basis of my French learning?...\n\n**Anki**\n\nEveryone recommends this, and there\u2019s a reason. It\u2019s how many med students get through medical school, and it\u2019s the basis of how I learned French. It\u2019s amazing. All it is is flashcards which get shown to you in a certain number/order every day based on how challenging they are for you. It was the main way I was able to retain what I learned, and it\u2019s brilliant for vocabulary, verb conjugations, and grammar. You know, just the major stuff you need for a language. \n\nThere\u2019s an android [app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki) which is what I used most of the time, but there\u2019s also a desktop/ios app. \n\nI used three decks, one which I made myself, one that was a [vocab deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/893324022), and one that was a collection of [French sentences](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1089240419). Lots of advice seems to say that you shouldn\u2019t use other people\u2019s decks, and that you should only make them yourself. I disagree. I learned a lot of vocab from these other Anki decks, and it was a good way to reinforce common French phrases. \n\nIt\u2019s very important to set the number of cards you see each day to something reasonable. I found seeing a total of 30 new cards over all my decks worked well for me. This didn\u2019t seem like enough initially, but as the number of cards I had increased, this number worked well. \n\nOne thing I wish I did better earlier on was creating my cards more effectively. There\u2019s lots of information online on how to do this, including some great stuff on Reddit. I love Cloze cards. They\u2019re a tad weird to learn how to use, but they\u2019re essentially just fill in the blanks. \nAs an example, I struggled with mixing up the verbs demeurer (to remain) and d\u00e9marrer (to start). I created two cards that looked like this:\n\nElle ne peut pas ____ en place. (She can not ____ in place)\n\nAnd \n\nNous devons _____ un processus dynamique. (We have to ____ a dynamic process)\n\nWhenever I saw these cards, I had to fill in the blanks and put the right verb in place. After I created and learned these cards, I never had a problem again. \n\n**Assimil** \n\nAssimil French With Ease is a classic French learning book which consists of a series of audio extracts which have French/English transcriptions in the text. It\u2019s a bit dated, but I found it was a fantastic resource for me to push me through A2. Assimil\u2019s suggestions on how to how to use their book wasn\u2019t what I followed. Instead, I followed the following:\n\n1.\tListen with the book closed.\n1.\tListen to the audio whilst reading the French transcription\n1.\tListen to the audio whilst reading the English translation\n1.\tListen whilst speaking along\n1.\tCreate Anki cards based on the lesson\n\nPrior to every lesson, I would also listen to the audio of the previous ten or so lessons as well. There\u2019s lots of different twists [online](https://forum.language-learners.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&amp;t=3720) that semi-follow the technique I used.\n\nI only used French With Ease, although they also have two other French books: Assimil Business French and Assimul \u2013 Using French, which are both at higher levels. All of these books can be purchased or obtained through alternative internet-based means. \n\n**Grammar**\n\nNo one likes grammar. It\u2019s boring, but also necessary. I bought a copy of Easy French Step-By-Step. There\u2019s loads of other grammar books out there, but I think picking up at least one is necessary. I was happy with this one. I also heavily used a youtube channel with lessons called [Learn French with Vincent](https://www.youtube.com/c/imagiers/playlists?view=50&amp;sort=dd&amp;shelf_id=6). French grammar is unfortunately stupidly complex, so you\u2019re never going to get it all correct, but a little bit of work here can make you sound like less of a fool! \n\nI'm sure you get the theme by now, but after learning some grammar, I would put cards into my Anki deck based on it.\n\n**Langcorrect**\n\n[Langcorrect](https://langcorrect.com/) is a website where language learners write short blocks of text and native speakers of my target language who are learning another language correct them. It\u2019s entirely free and it has been a really fantastic way for me to get feedback all the way from about A2 until now. When I wasn\u2019t at the stage where I was comfortable speaking with other people, this was my main way to get feedback on my French. Because it is a community-based thing, it is very important that you correct at least as much work as you receive corrections for! Generally, I tried to make my writing entertaining; I would often make them silly stories. All of the corrections I received became Anki cards.\n\n**Podcasts**\n\nEveryone loves a good podcast whilst commuting. Here\u2019s the ones I listened to:\n\n* Innerfrench \u2013 Really high quality and always recommended. Great for levels A2-lower B1, but you will outgrow it\n\n* Duolingo French Podcast \u2013 Great for levels A2-lower B1. I ripped on duolingo earlier, but their podcast is fairly decent. I found there was a bit too much English in their French podcasts though!\n\n* Rocket French \u2013 Levels A1-A2\n\n* Coffee Break French \u2013 Levels A2-B1\n\n* Learn French By Podcast \u2013 Levels A1-B1\n\n* RFI \u2013 Journal en fran\u00e7ais facile \u2013 Level B1-B2 \u2013 A daily news podcast that is done in easy French\n\nOnce you reach B1, you start to get to the stage where all the podcasts/resources for learners are too easy for you, but all the native content is too hard. This is what I call \u201cintermediate hell\u201d. To make the transition to native content easier, I found that nature/ecology focussed podcasts were often simpler to understand than others despite their complex topics due to their \u201cDavid Attenboroughesque\u201d speaking style. One I would recommend trying is Sur Les \u00c9paules De Darwin.\n\n\n**TV Shows/Movies/Videos**\n\nThere\u2019s a fantastic chrome extension called [Language Learning with Netflix](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/language-learning-with-ne/hoombieeljmmljlkjmnheibnpciblicm?hl=en) that I used heavily. It lets you watch Netflix with subtitles in both English and French simultaneously, and allows you to blur the text out as you progress. It has loads of features like pausing the video after a sentence and so on. It was crucial for me. I originally started with both English and French subtitles displayed, then the English ones blurred, and then both the English and French ones blurred. It\u2019s important to progress away from just having subtitles fully displayed so that you are actually listening and not just reading the English or French subtitles. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nSome Netflix series that I watched/would recommend:\n\n* Au Service de la France\n* Marseille \n* H\n* Appelez mon agent\n* D\u00e9rapages\n\nIt eventually reached the point where I was just watching whatever trash I could find in native French, which included:\n\n* Le cercle \n* Plan Coeur\n* Tout part en fum\u00e9e\n\n*Outside of Netflix,* there\u2019s an animated series of almost all the Tintin comics, that I\u2019d recommend watching. Innerfrench also has a youtube channel and I quite enjoyed [this standup show.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx27SKPG1cw2s-frS_rws2pPSVpXlaPfi) In addition, [Lumni.fr](https://www.lumni.fr/) and [FranceCulture.fr](https://www.franceculture.fr/) both have a large amount of educational video content that I found interesting. Some of it is geo-blocked, but a lot of it is very well produced.\n\n**Reading**\n\nI found reading crucial to learn new vocab and see grammar in context. I read the following:\n\n1. Le Petit Prince\n1. Tin Tin\n1. Various young adult fiction\n1. Several books from Mondes en VF\n\nThe last one is a series of books that are written specifically for language learners but focus on adult topics. As a result, these books are much more interesting than many young adult books. They also come with an audio version which is a nice accompaniment.\n\n**Speaking With Natives**\n\nIt\u2019s inevitable, and you are going to feel like a fool for the first few times, but you will eventually get over the fear and learn to enjoy speaking. I had a couple of tutors through [Italki](https://www.italki.com/) who I would setup lessons with once or twice a week. I found it incredibly motivating and it was also very noticeable how much faster my French progressed when I was speaking regularly. \n\nThere are also a few websites or apps out there that allow you to find language exchange partners. This has the advantage of being free, but I found it challenging to find someone who was motivated and I could speak to regularly. This [innerfrench video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00TbnnCNEiA) goes through several of the sites/apps to find a language exchange partner. On a couple of the apps I found people seemed to be more keen to use the apps \u00e0 la Tinder than for language exchange, as a minor word of warning.\n\n**Accent Reduction**\n\nListening to French/speaking it will gradually improve your accent, but I still found mine terrible. I used [WorkAudioBook](http://www.workaudiobook.com/) to help improve my accent. It\u2019s a program where you can play an audio file and then record yourself speaking and compare the difference. I used this quite heavily on my Mondes en VF books. It's not exactly the nicest looking program, but it definitely was useful for me.\n\nAnother useful resource for me was various youtube channels focussed on pronunciation. One I would recommend is [this one](https://www.youtube.com/user/frenchsounds) (FrenchSounds). \n\n**Miscellaneous Resources**\n\nMy favourite translator website is [this one](https://conjugator.reverso.net/). It provides really nice conjugation tables as well as good sentences in context.\n\nI completed [this](https://www.coursera.org/learn/etudier-en-france/home/welcome) free online course. I would give it as a decent recommendation if you\u2019re at a B1 level. Some of it is better than others, but I found their sections on pronunciation quite good.\n\nWhen I struggled to come up with topics to write about, I found [this list](http://iteslj.org/questions/) of topics useful. \n\nMy favourite French news sites are [RFI](https://www.rfi.fr/fr) and [Le Monde](https://www.lemonde.fr/), both have large amounts of free content accessible and good apps to read from. RFI also has a large series of podcasts.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "learnfrench", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sucz", "subreddit_subscribers": 49496, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A1 \u2013 B2 French - How I did it and my Resources", "total_awards_received": 2, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnfrench/comments/nzf9zq/a1_b2_french_how_i_did_it_and_my_resources/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1623647494.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "beiweitemderbeste", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2fm4w5o9", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1623355497, "domain": "self.NonZeroDay", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/NonZeroDay/comments/nwx2gx/100daysofcode_day_7_success_it_is/", "gildings": {}, "id": "nwx2gx", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/NonZeroDay/comments/nwx2gx/100daysofcode_day_7_success_it_is/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "nnmvZitIdtl3UJSov7ZcIqMwnFG7OvGcVvkNPR4Vsrc", "resolutions": [{"height": 56, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/pLSR0Rpmlm0YOrI_U2sKzEeF87LsInGWnlb54-hObD0.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6cfffb7d905036a18de683f4858275559647f8cb", "width": 108}, {"height": 113, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/pLSR0Rpmlm0YOrI_U2sKzEeF87LsInGWnlb54-hObD0.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c56f4d07956aae6d02302bd31040c6013026d3ac", "width": 216}, {"height": 167, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/pLSR0Rpmlm0YOrI_U2sKzEeF87LsInGWnlb54-hObD0.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66f1d899c02d5073461c22dc9e3587384dbf6136", "width": 320}, {"height": 334, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/pLSR0Rpmlm0YOrI_U2sKzEeF87LsInGWnlb54-hObD0.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=579175bb293e955ce6b51dadc675c17e41f0b0ca", "width": 640}, {"height": 502, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/pLSR0Rpmlm0YOrI_U2sKzEeF87LsInGWnlb54-hObD0.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95ba17f421b486a5508eaecb231f9ba8eae35bbc", "width": 960}, {"height": 565, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/pLSR0Rpmlm0YOrI_U2sKzEeF87LsInGWnlb54-hObD0.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eda6808809eea88cdc4032df689fc389cbaa90c9", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 628, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/pLSR0Rpmlm0YOrI_U2sKzEeF87LsInGWnlb54-hObD0.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=1370f7fc33eccde041bb8d913fc5ef24401c04f5", "width": 1200}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1623357731, "score": 1, "selftext": "I'm taking another course: [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/home/welcome), it's a free course on coursera which I highly recommend.

Active learning is when you actually sit down and learn sth, passive learning is when you do the dishes afterwards or take a walk.

Here is a quick review\n\n**GENERAL THOUGHTS**\n\nThe course is aimed at people who want to study in a francophone country. Some of the content and vocabulary is quite specific to this. However, I have no intention of studying abroad, and I did not find the course irrelevant. \n\nThe course comprises six weekly units. Each week has listening, reading, pronunciation, vocabulary, writing and grammar lessons. There is also a weekly optional discussion. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Listening: typically watching a video or listening to audio and answering questions. Varies in difficult. Some of the listening I found extremely hard. Mostly taken from films and TV news -- very few interviews or natural, informal conversation. \n* Reading: answering questions about a short French text. The types of text varied, from news reports to creative writing. \n* Pronunciation: this often focused on the nuances within French pronunciation. For instance, one of the units focused on the difference between en/on/un. Was interesting and usually not so difficult. \n* Grammar: this was quite technical. Topics included the subjunctive, and agreement of the pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9. The quiz questions were really hard. The instructor (Olivier Bertrand) was good though, and his videos gave an interesting overview of the etymology of various French words. \n* Vocabulary: tends to focus on university-related stuff\n* Writing: typically 100-300 words on a particular topic. Quite varied, and one of the exercises is to write a formal letter. You are required to peer-grade two other submissions. It is motivating to know that one's submission will be graded by other people. \n\nThere are three course instructors: 2 female, 1 male. All were good presenters, and spoke in a clear French accent. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PROS**\n\n* Very clear structure. A six-week course with a completely linear structure meant I could get into a daily routine of working through the course. \n* Good coverage of different language-learning areas (as above).\n* Varied content, including good use of a range of media (e.g. film extracts, music videos).\n* There are some high-quality resources available as a PDF throughout the course.\n* The course is delivered by the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, one of the prestigious French [*grandes \u00e9coles*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandes_%C3%A9coles)*.* Looks good on a CV if you care about this sort of thing, though obviously it's just a MOOC. \n* It's free\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CONS**\n\n* Some of the lessons take much less time than others. Writing was often 1 hour +, pronunciation \\~20 mins\n* I didn't mind the focus on universities and student life, but some of the listening and reading was extremely turgid, e.g. listening to a lecture of academic philosophy. \n* I did wonder how representative of real French life some of the content was. In one of the writing exercises, for instance, it was necessary to write a formal application letter in French. The 'correct' answers were insanely pompuous and over-written.
