You may even want to look at jobs you want, see the skill requirements, and work backwards till your CV matches that job. \n   * You only have so much time in life to learn anything.  You can't do it all.  Pursue a balance of what interests you + what will make you valuable.  This may seem obvious, but no one ever explicitly told me that outside of school lots of people read/study philosophy, culture, history, etc. While in undergrad I thought if I didn't study those subjects now I probably never would, that was only partially true. \n* Learning how to write &amp; read is learning how to think.  You're not doing those writing assignments for a grade. The better you are at thinking the better you'll be at problem-solving.

Clearly you\u2019ve come to realize that you\u2019ve been taught untrue things in some way, right? So that\u2019s the first step and a good sign that you are, in fact, a critical thinker.\n\nThere are infinite podcasts, books, YouTube channels, etc. out there. Google your information sources to find out what biases they have and what other people say about them (tells you if they are mainstream or controversial and if controversial, why). Look up the scientific method and learn about how scientists come to conclusions and look up logical fallacies so you can spot them when you see them. \n\nQuestion everything. If an article says \u201c#% of X is Y,\u201d but doesn\u2019t cite the study they got that statistic from, be skeptical. Learn a bit about statistics and data and take a look on Google scholar to see if cited research actually means what the citer says it means. Or if that is beyond your abilities, at least be aware of who conducted studies and why. If it is a religious university that teaches creationism doing archeological research, that tells you something important about their bias. If it is a study about the safety or value of a food or other product and it is sponsored/funded by the industry that produces that product, that tells you something important about their bias.\n\nYou might consider taking free courses on topics that interest you. There are even classes specifically about critical thinking: https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=critical%20thinking . Again, always consider your source. A class taught by a respected public university professor is going to have a different perspective than something posted on YouTube from the controversial conservative-biased PragerU.\n\nLastly, be very careful about social media. There are so many fake profiles and so much misinformation. The first thing that really opened my eyes to it was this: https://spotthetroll.org/start. The first time I took the test, I had a really hard time telling which profiles were fake, especially when it was an account that aligned with my personal political views. My biases kept me from seeing things clearly and made me more vulnerable to left-leaning misinformation. Be careful of conformation bias and thinking something is true just because it conforms to your world view. If someone posts a story, Google it. Did mainstream news outlets publish an article about it with appropriate sources? Did someone pull the facts from a satire website like Babylon Bee or the Onion or the Borowitz Report? Is the source an anonymous blog or does the person put their real name and photo on it? Has it been fact checked by a place like Snopes or Politifact? Those aren\u2019t definitive, but it does help. Here\u2019s a decent guide on this topic: https://subjectguides.library.american.edu/News-Literacy\n\nYou are not going to get it right 100% of the time. You are not always going to have time to check and double check sources and be educated and up to date on every topic unless you are independently wealthy and don\u2019t need to work, take care of a family, etc. There is an atheist debater I used to listen to whose philosophy on religion boils down to: \u201cI want to believe as many true things and as few false things as possible.\u201d This statement has not been without criticism for being overly simplistic, but I still quite like it. What it means to me personally (not necessarily the person who coined it) is that we are not perfect and there is no way to know everything and be 100% right all the time. But we should try our best to seek truth where we can and dispel our incorrect beliefs and assumptions whenever possible, because truth matters. So do not make yourself \u201ccrazy\u201d doing all of the things I suggested. Do your best and always be open to being corrected and learning new things. Scientific understanding changes and develops over time. We similarly should be flexible in changing our minds when presented with new information, while treating each other with compassion and grace when we inevitably get something wrong.", "body_sha1": "cfefa381fd82d850f1e708df58ead0aba13262e1", "can_gild": true, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1627564126, "distinguished": null, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "h6ya43b", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_otu2y5", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_otu2y5", "permalink": "/r/ReligiousTrauma/comments/otu2y5/how_did_you_escape_the_brainwashing_and_how_did/h6ya43b/", "retrieved_utc": 1627564172, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ReligiousTrauma", "subreddit_id": "t5_29ns5z", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/ReligiousTrauma", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1627564126.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "archived": false, "associated_award": null, "author": "blockoyster", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6cg6p8dp", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "body": "I recommend this free course:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHelped me a bunch.", "body_sha1": "8abf1f4e4bedda9c4253648ec5f145b162d8d36f", "can_gild": true, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1627471979, "distinguished": null, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "h6thfx5", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ot3xha", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_ot3xha", "permalink": "/r/IWantToLearn/comments/ot3xha/iwtl_how_to_be_an_efficient_learner/h6thfx5/", "retrieved_utc": 1627472020, "score": 1, "score_hidden": true, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/IWantToLearn", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1627471979.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "JuniusBobbledoonary", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_jd0fx3m", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Do this quick course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn\n\nIt's just a series of videos and tells you everything you need to know.

Spend 1-3 hours in little bursts looking up how to study and prepare for school and start organized and on top of things. YouTube is full of videos. \n* TLDR, recall is good as is spaced repetition. Reading the textbook is not that great.\n* Have more time? The [Learning how to Learn video on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) is popular. There's also several books, How to Become a Straight-A Student by Cal Newport being another popular one. \n* Find out where you are at. Take tests. Khan Academy is good for math, find our what you know and what you don't so you can study and get back up to Grade 12 level. Do you remember how atom structure works? No? Well now you know how to study it.\n* As an adult student they may push for you to take a review science / math course first. See if syllabus is online to figure out if you need this. Also, consider finding a tutor contact. It might be a bit expensive, but it's likely a good investment if stuck.\n* Use a planner!! Depending on your career, you might have been okay with a calender since 9-5 plus occasional oh right a dentist appointment. You will now have 5+ classes with overlapping weekly goals. Find some planning system; Paper, Google Calendar, Notion, Todoist, I don't care. As well, when you get all your paperwork try to input everything at once, and set mini-goals. That giant essay is far off, but if you set a goal to have all your research prepared a month before then you shouldn't be panicking at 3 AM.\n* Sleep good. \n* Apply for every scholarship and bursary you can. Ask for help if you need. You have a financial aid office. \n* If you have any disablities, physical or functioning, or think you do, go look into that and disablity services. For example I got diagnosed with ADHD at 28. My school has offered; I am allow calculator on exams, all syllabus changes must be followed in writing via follow up email, I have access to their Zoom class closed captioning and read outloud software for e-books. \n* If you work full time or have kids, you might need to discuss things and move stuff around.

The seventh is a deep dive into pointers and one of best tutorial on pointers and arrays out there (caveat, it's a little loose with the l-value/r-value definition for simplicity sake I believe.)\n\n[Play the long game when learning to code.](\nhttps://stackoverflow.blog/2020/10/05/play-the-long-game-when-learning-to-code/) \n\nYou can also check out [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)\n\nHere is a decent list of [8 Books on Algorithms and Data Structures For All Levels](https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/books-about-data-structures-algorithms)", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1626168599, "gildings": {}, "id": "h50pj3f", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_oj79q6", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_oj79q6", "permalink": "/r/C_Programming/comments/oj79q6/hello_all_im_new_to_reddit_i_created_it_just_to/h50pj3f/", "retrieved_on": 1626332498, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "C_Programming", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhoe", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1626168599.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "praqueviver", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_motrvpz", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Amigo, faz [esse curso](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) no coursera... garanto que vai te ajudar.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1626052008, "gildings": {}, "id": "h4vcsss", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_oigfcq", "locked": false, "no_follow": false, "parent_id": "t3_oigfcq", "permalink": "/r/brasil/comments/oigfcq/como_estudar_me_ajudem/h4vcsss/", "retrieved_on": 1626227123, "score": 9, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "brasil", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh9i", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1626052008.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "Lacey_K_3531", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_o9yf6qw", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Math should be the least of your worries...

Keep reminding yourself that Game Development is what you want to do as you dive into how you want to approach that path. It's far to easy to quickly get sucked into tutorials and get overwhelmed as you take in all the information you come across... \n\nI recommend creating a new email account solely dedicated to your journey into coding.

You'll want to download git (version controller) (looking into npms will be useful but later down the line) which code editor you'll want (vs code, atom if mac, sublime text 3 if windows) vs code is favored. Could go on for ages...\n\nThere is a lot to learn and where your going to learn it might just be the most tedious decision... For free from freecodecamp, Shay Howe, an apprenticeship (available from where I'm at via Techtonic) or free bootcamp for specific groups of people (i.e. Justice Reskill) etc... \nYou could download career karma (they partner with numerous bootcamps at a cost). They just added an offer for getting college credit through one of them on completion in addition to gaining a certificate and they have just added a path for game development. \n\nGood luck (especially if or when you take on JavaScript, it was a bitch and then some for me) and have fun... It will be fun, once you understand the concepts.

I'm proud to say that what I did helped me immensely, and not only can I now say that I know how to speak French, but I got early acceptance into the law school this year! Here's what I did: \n\n\\- The first (and most important) thing that I did was devote a serious amount of time to practice-- a combination of reading, writing, speaking, and comprehension. I put aside three hours each day to work, and made sure that I was being honest about the time that I spent actually working. This was the hardest part (because I had a full-time job), but it was essential to my learning. You need to put in the time or else you won't see the results. \n\n\\- I structured my learning time rigidly so as not to fall into a habit of doing easier work just to give myself a break. I spent my first hour doing grammar exercises in a French workbook that I got secondhand ([thriftbooks.com](https://thriftbooks.com) have some good options), my second hour reading in French, and my third hour watching a French TV show with French subtitles. I did this everyday. In order to not be bored I changed up the books I was reading, the TV shows, etc, but it was definitely hard. \n\n\\-On the days that I didn't have the learning schedule I listed above, I took online French courses at night. These cost money so if you don't want to do that I understand, but they had the largest effect on my French abilities than anything else I did by far. Self-guided learning is good but it can't replace being in a classroom for me. I took classes at various Cegep's (in Quebec they're schools that are in-between highschool and university that offer cheap courses and programs), which made them really cheap (around $250 per 40 hours of classtime). My favourite Cegeps to learn from were Dawson College, Vanier College, and Cegep Jonqui\u00e8re but there are others. Throughout the year I ended up taking about 6 of these classes, each lasting anywhere from a month (intensive) to a few months. \n\n\\-Finally, I forced myself to use French in my daily life. I spoke with anyone that would listen in French, I was constantly trying to translate sentences and conversations in my head, and I listened to French podcasts. \n\nIf you're serious about learning you'll get there, I believe in you :) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS. If you only want to take free French classes there are a few online, notably with MOOC and Coursera. I'd recommend them too!

Research studies/overviews: [one example](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30415609/) // [another example](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3904694/) // [three](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25448230/) and [this overview of research studies](https://nutrition.bmj.com/content/early/2020/06/09/bmjnph-2019-000053) (but I initially learned about that effect of probiotics from [this readable article](https://www.wm.edu/research/news/science-and-technology/comfort-food123.php)). [This is a good overview of 11 FOODS](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/11-super-healthy-probiotic-foods) that are considered probiotics (unlike probiotic supplements, they can't cause damage, plus they give you nutrients that are good for your brain). At least 2-3 foods from that list will be available to you easily. \n2. **Self-help/self-therapy books written by therapists/psychologists.** The one I've found most helpful, full-coverage, yet very readable: The Happiness Trap by Dr Russ Harriss \u2014 it explains dangerous misconceptions about happiness, gives you simple techniques for dealing with unpleasant thoughts &amp; feelings, guides you through identifying your values, gives you techniques for living by them (it makes your life feel more meaningful &amp; fulfilling, unlike when you just chase your goals). \n3. **Meditation.** Over time, it increases your ability for self-control (makes your prefrontal cortex thicker/denser, from what I remember), makes you calmer, less stressed out; increases the quality of your decisions. Headspace, Calm, Waking Up with Sam Harriss (this one has scientific explanations) are top apps for that; or just use the instructions from the sidebar in [this Harvard University' article](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/04/less-stress-clearer-thoughts-with-mindfulness-meditation/); even 5min can make a big difference for the whole day; don't get discouraged if you get distracted often \u2014 even a meditation *attempt* is a training session for your brain, you will notice benefits during the day.\n4. **Journaling.** If you want to talk about something but have nobody to do it with, it helps; it also helps to just process stuff. Apparently, there ar eeven research studies and books about the value of 'expressive journaling' for self-therapy/transformation, by Dr. Pennebaker.\n5. **Writing a letter to your Future Self** (future self-continuity is a good thing: [explanations](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/27208) and [excited explanations](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af)). If I'm really stuck &amp; demotivated, it helps (I do it in a free tool, futureme.org.) Probably because I need to be coherent enough for someone specific to be able to understand me (e.g. Future Self of 3mo from now), I know that someone specific will read my email. Somewhere in the process of writing &amp; editing full solutions or just first steps become obvious. \n6. **Getting enough sleep, on a healthy schedule.** You ability for self-control increases, your emotional resilience increases; your learning abilities increase (one of the functions of sleep is memory consolidation); you protect yourself from permanent brain damage. \n7. **Getting enough nutrients.** E.g. deficiency in vitamins of B group makes you more neurotic. Vitamin C deficiency turns you into a vegetable (and the more refined carbs you consume, the more vit C your body needs) because of how important it is for good memory, energy, etc. Iron deficiency might make you feel low-energy (btw, caffeine consumption within 1h of eating plant sources of iron massively decreases iron absorption).\n8. **BrainHQ training** (the only program that meets the criteria of The Institute of Medicine\u2019s Checklist for *scientifically proven* brain-training programs, [source](https://www.brainhq.com/world-class-science/institute-medicine-checklist-brain-training/) + [research studies](https://www.brainhq.com/world-class-science/published-research)); their monthly subscription is cheap; it's a gamified online training tool (30min 3+ times per week is the recommended training schedule). It's the way to improve your memory, attention, brain speed, etc. Increases your feeling of self-efficacy, the quality of your decisions, accuracy, etc. \n9. Spending time in nature. It's restorative, stress-reducing, puts your mind in meditative state. \n10. (my own trick, for solving complex problems or when I feel really lost) Spending 2h+ chunks of time alone, on the floor (on the carpet/fleece blanket) with screen devices off, no audio content, no print media. Day 1 of this may just be an adjustment to 'doing nothing', but the next sessions will be helpful. You start getting useful insights via the diffuse mode of thinking; sober up &amp; remember what's truly important to you &amp; regain energy for implementing that (because when you pollute your mind with media consumption for hours, there is just not enough space for that to happen); the whole thing feels restorative. \n11. **Figuring out your food sensitivites.** E.g. some people have gluten sensitivity &amp; get grumpy, annoyed, brain-foggy when consume it. I feel very depressed the next day after eating chocolate \u2014 it messes up with my oxytocin levels I guess.\n12. Taking good care of your gene expression. Dirty Genes is one of the books that explains how. There are things that only high-income people can afford, but there are things that are totally free to implement and even them make a big difference.\n\n**Helpful reference lists:**\n\n* **Various stuff that increases your sense of well-being, research-based,** with references to supporting research studies https://my.happify.com/research/ Some of that stuff is covered in the free online course by Yale University, The Science of Well-Being](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being/).\n* For dealing with / recovering after mistakes: Ray Dalio's 6 steps (open-access explanations are in [this article](https://qz.com/363628/learning-from-mistakes-can-change-your-fortune-or-earn-you-one/), under \"The six questions\" heading).\n* For dealing with problems: [this extended version](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBuJoMethodBookClub/comments/ebn64y/week_37_inertia/fb61mlc) of Rubber Ducking technique.\n* For building/changing habits: the lists under 'Where to Go From Here\n' heading at https://jamesclear.com/three-steps-habit-change\n* For decision-making: Heath brothers' structured summary of their own book, Decisive.

Depending on when you were in school, you may or may not have been exposed to any of the difficult truths in our shared history, or if you were, it was likely from a colonial power's perspective. Bob Joseph's book,  \"21 Things You May Not Know About the Indian Act\" is a great place to start. If you want to go broader and deeper, the University of Alberta's free course, \"Indigenous Canada\" was put together and delivered by an Indigenous team, and is very informative and impactful.\nhttps://www.ictinc.ca/books/21-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-indian-act\nhttps://www.coursera.org/learn/indigenous-canada\n\n&gt; Support Indigenous nonprofits &lt;\nThere are many organizations that are doing great work by supporting residential school survivors and their families, providing scholarships to Indigenous youth, funding language renewal, and so on. In BC, of particular relevance is the The Indian Residential School Survivor Society (IRSSS). Nationally, Indspire does remarkable work. They are \"an Indigenous national charity that invests in the education of First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis people for the long-term benefit of these individuals, their families and communities, and Canada.\"\nhttps://www.irsss.ca/home\nhttps://indspire.ca/\n\n&gt; Support Indigenous businesses &lt;\nWith the Covid-19 situation, many Indigenous businesses are struggling, especially those that relied on tourism and travel. To find an Indigenous business to support is easy at Shop First Nations. Their mission is \"To bolster First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis businesses by encouraging consumers to invest in Indigenous goods and services, and supporting such businesses in the digital economy while honoring Truth &amp; Reconciliation.\"\nhttps://shopfirstnations.com/\n\nSome other thoughts (and keep in mind I have no idea if you know these already, so no offense intended, I'm just trying to add to the overall context):\n\nThere are hundreds of distinct Indigenous communities, so what they might want is not one thing or the same thing.\n\nGiven that they're grieving, we non-Indigenous need to minimize our asks of them, especially in terms of the self-education we need to be doing for ourselves.\n\nReading the final TRC report and seeing which of the 94 recommendations we can adopt personally and communally.\n\nChallenging our government representatives, at every level, in terms of what their commitment to the TRC, UNDRIP, etc., actually is in practice.\n\nCalling out our friends, family and acquaintances when they perpetuate harmful stereotypes.\n\nSupporting Indigenous artists by exploring and paying for their art and performances. \n\nSubscribing to and paying for Indigenous news and journalism. Examples I'm familiar with include APTN (National) and Indiginews (BC).\n\nLearning what traditional lands we live and work on, and learning how to pronounce the names of those FNs, the names of their languages, and their most important place names.\n\nThat's a start.
