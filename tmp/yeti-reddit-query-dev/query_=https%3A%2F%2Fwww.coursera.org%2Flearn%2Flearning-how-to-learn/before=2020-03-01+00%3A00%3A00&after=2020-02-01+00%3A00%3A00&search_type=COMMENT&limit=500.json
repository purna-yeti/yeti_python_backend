On January 30th, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared an outbreak of the Novel Coronavirus, now officially referred to as COVID19. As the epidemic seems to spread to more and more countries, people around the world are wondering about the trajectory of the epidemic and whether they should be concerned. Media reports of the epidemic often focus on the more eye-catching events: governments evacuating their citizens from Hubei province, passengers on cruise ships being stopped from disembarking following a detection of a case, or images of supermarket supplies running out in areas perceived to be at high risk. On social media, other reports about the epidemic range from unsupported rumours to deliberate disinformation are increasing a sense of panic many individuals are experiencing. Robust, reliable analysis is vital at this stage not only as a way to give concerned members of the public a sense of perspective, but also to support governments and other stakeholders in planning their responses. Researchers at the MRC Centre of Global Infectious Diseases Analysis (GIDA) and the Jameel Institute for Disease Emergency Analytics (J-IDEA) have been working hard on coming up with reliable estimates of the spread of the epidemic and its prospects, and are doing this in close collaboration with a number of global stakeholders, including the World Health Organisation (WHO). You will hear directly from the experts conducting the analyses. You will be able learn about the current state of the epidemic, while also learn about the epidemiological and public-health principles and challenges that underpin these analyses. This will include understanding how the spread of the epidemic is modelled, how transmissibility of infections is estimated, what the challenges are in estimating the case fatality ratio, and also learning about the importance of community involvement in responding to the epidemic. If you want to learn more about infectious disease modelling, epidemiology, participatory approaches in public health, or health economics, a number of free MOOCs are available from Imperial College London. We also offer a fully online Global Master of Public Health for those of you who want to delve even deeper, as well as free online open courses.

Inevitably, things will come up in your life that are largely or entirely out of your control. This is just part of life. While you cannot change certain circumstances, you can change your attitude towards them. Trying to control the things you can't can often backfire and make you more stressed out.[6]\nEvery time you think of something that you cannot control, write it on a piece of paper. Place it in a box and move on. Letting go of stressful situations or people will allow you to work on the things you can control.\nImage titled Get a Life Step 8\n2\nLive in the present. Think about how you will make today better, instead of always working toward a future goal. If you life too far ahead in the future all the time, you are missing out on life. Life only happens in the present moment. While this isn't a recommendation to live every day like it is your last, because every day is not actually your last, it is a good idea to spend some time each day enjoying the present moment. To live more in the present, you can:[7]\nDo only one task at a time; avoid multitasking.\nPut some space in between your day to day tasks to give you some time to reflect and not feel too rushed.\nSet aside 5-10 minutes each day to do absolutely nothing at all but sit in silence.\nEat slowly and focus on the flavor and texture of your food.\nImage titled Get a Life Step 9\n3\nDo something new every week. Get an activity guide for your city, ask some friends, or dig around online for fun things to do near you. Take a risk and try some new activities. Go by yourself or ask a friend or your significant other. What matters most is that you are trying something novel and being open-minded about it. Trying something new can have a number of benefits, such as:[8]\nGiving you courage by facing the unknown.\nFighting off boredom.\nAllowing you to grow via new experiences.\nImage titled Get a Life Step 10\n4\nLearn something new. Take a class online or in person or watch some free lectures online. A lifelong learning center can provide an inexpensive opportunity to learn photography, social media or another skill you've been wanting to master. You can try these websites to search for classes or lectures that interest you:\nhttps://www.coursera.org/\nhttp://oyc.yale.edu/\nhttps://www.edx.org/\nAdvertisement\nPart 3 of 4:\nSetting Work Limits\nImage titled Get a Life Step 11\n1\nDo not work on weekends. Make sure you have two days per week to devote to yourself and/or your family. Make the working weekend something that is abnormal, not normal. If you can cut down time in the work domain, you will find more time for other important life domains.\nTry to keep in mind that work is like a gas, it will continue to expand if you let it. It will take up more and more of your time. You can always work more. There will always be more work to be done. Just save it for a week day!\nImage titled Get a Life Step 12\n2\nTurn off electronic devices when you get home. Ask your family to do the same for several hours per day, so that you can connect. Studies show that checking your email less can make you happier, so turn your phone off and spend some quality time with those you love.[9]\nImage titled Get a Life Step 13\n3\nTake a risk at work. Volunteer for something or go the extra mile on a project. Showing initiative and using more of your intellect can make work more fulfilling.[10]\nThat said, keep in mind that balance in your life is important, too. You will have to ask yourself whether it is worth putting in that extra work time to do something fulfilling even if it means taking time away from other important life domains. Only you can answer that question for yourself.\nImage titled Get a Life Step 14\n4\nRemember why you work in the first place. Most of us work in order to be able to enjoy life. If you are spending all your time working and you are not having any time to spend with your family or to do the things you love, then you need to find ways to cut back.\nKeep in mind, however, that if you get lots of meaning out of your work and view your job as giving you the life that you want, then it is totally fine to work a lot. What matters is what you view as important in defining your life.\nAdvertisement\nPart 4 of 4:\nGetting Healthier\nImage titled Get a Life Step 15\n1\nGet exercise. Working your heart and muscles for at least 30 minutes a day will actually help you live healthier and longer.[11] Try some of these ideas to improve your physical life:\nPlan outdoor and adventurous activities with your family. Make exercise fun several nights a week or on the weekend. Go hiking, biking, explore your local city on foot or play a sport.\nJoin an adult sport league or active hobby group. If you miss being part of a team, join a soccer, kickball or basketball league. Most cities and suburbs have many options, and they schedule games after work and on weekends.\nTry a new workout. If you usually go to the gym, try new classes or get outside to walk or run several days a week. Break up your routine.\nImage titled Get a Life Step 16\n2\nWalk in nature. Experiencing the beauty of nature can lead to feelings of awe and make you feel more wondrous.[12] So, get out in nature whenever you can for your health and for getting a sense of wonder.\nImage titled Get a Life Step 17\n3\nGet plenty of sleep. Give yourself 8 hours plus an hour to get ready and an hour to wake up. The result can be a relaxed, happier self. Make sure to stick to a routine; falling into a typical pattern of sleep can help you fall asleep each night. [13]\nMake sure to create a dark, noise free room that can help you sleep. Also, avoid drinking caffeine close to when you go to sleep or you may have trouble falling asleep.\nImage titled Get a Life Step 18\n4\nVolunteer for a charity. Donate your time and connect with people who need your help. Studies have shown that volunteering for a charity can make you happier, improve empathy and make you feel fulfilled.[14]\nTo find a charity, search online, ask around in your neighborhood, or look in your local newspaper for opportunities to volunteer.\nImage titled Get a Life Step 19\n5\nBuild your relationships and support system. Pick at least an hour a week where you can interact with people who are important to you without distractions from work. This will increase your mental well being and decrease your stress; social support is very important for health.

I was lucky to have a supporting partner; lucky with patient teaching assistants, supervisors, and mentors; lucky to pursue a subject that aligned with what the lab was interested in; lucky with various people taking a chance on me career-wise; etc.\n\n---\n\nTL;DR: a combination of hard work and dumb luck.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1580941178, "gildings": {}, "id": "fgnb52j", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ez8b4e", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_fgmko8e", "permalink": "/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/ez8b4e/is_a_career_in_aiml_possible_for_an_average/fgnb52j/", "retrieved_on": 1580943366, "score": 2, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "learnmachinelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_3cqa1", "total_awards_received": 0, "created": 1580941178.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "Crouchingtigerhere", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_31hd2xld", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "body": "[Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1580821813, "gildings": {}, "id": "fgihixf", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_eyp00o", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_fgid8er", "permalink": "/r/GetMotivated/comments/eyp00o/imageeducate_yourself/fgihixf/", "retrieved_on": 1580821814, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "GetMotivated", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rmfx", "total_awards_received": 0, "created": 1580821813.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "ButeusSmaximus", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1yfgk37p", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Also the Learning How to Learn free course on Coursera.com is quite useful too and compiles a lot of the concepts into lecture-sized chunks, plus there\u2019s multiple choice quizzes and optional assignments too.\n\nI find out about it through reddit (forget exactly where though) and would highly recommend it to anyone, and they even have an app too which I thought was pretty convenient.

I would look into translation services between English and your native language as one of the ways you could make money.\n\nLong term, I think it's good if you leave this situation, but first you will need a foundation for independence. Here is my suggestions for you:\n\nFirst, learn how to form good habits. This is a very good outline here: [https://readingraphics.com/book-summary-atomic-habits/](https://readingraphics.com/book-summary-atomic-habits/)\n\nsecond, make meditation a part of your daily routine. Start with 5 minutes and slowly grow to 20 mins per day.\n\n1. Sit or lie comfortably. \n2. Close your eyes. ...\n3. Make no effort to control the breath; simply breathe naturally.\n4. Focus your attention on the breath and on how the body moves with each inhalation and exhalation. When you get lost in thought, which will happen often, just gently bring yourself back to focusing on your breath each time.\n\nNext, you must learn how to learn. here is a good online course for that: [https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)\n\nFinally, work on exposure therapy for your anxiety- challenge yourself a little bit at a time to get into social situations and you will start to get used to it. Also see if there are any free therapy resources in your country or online for you to access.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1580581555, "gildings": {}, "id": "fg7151k", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_exa37j", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_exa37j", "permalink": "/r/Advice/comments/exa37j/im_desperate_and_need_help/fg7151k/", "retrieved_on": 1580581557, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Advice", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjdm", "total_awards_received": 0, "created": 1580581555.0}]
