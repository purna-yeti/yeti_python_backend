It took me a long, long time to realize talent needs to be cultivated by a lot of effort, not just sporadically, but over a long period of time.  Regardless of having \"talent\", I never really learned how to develop a \"deep understanding\" of how things worked or  what it mean to learn something difficult in a systematic way - I just thought I knew.   \n\nI felt a lot of overwhelming pressure in me all through uni.  I started taking anti-depressants in my sophomore year - I ended up having a breakdown right before graduation - I needed to complete one last technical course, but I dropped out right at the finish line.  I just couldn't do it at the time, and I was even too ashamed to admit this to my family so at the time, I just lied.  Now I was a gifted failure.  Looking back, it wasn't a big deal, but I had already failed 1 course previously, and I thought the rules were that you couldn't fail 2 courses (I didn't realize you could appeal to academic committee for re-instatement because I'd never failed at something this big before).\n\nOver a lot of years, and a lot of hard knocks, I developed a lot more personal insight into my struggles.  I ended up going back to school to finish my degree and just move on and started a new successful career (going back through a STEM program after many years away was really hard, but I did it).  Yes, I regret not finishing \"on time\", but I had to let that go.  More importantly, I got over a lot of my inner fears, picked up a lot on how to develop discipline (google: how to make habits), set and achieve goals, and really learned how to learn.\n\nIf there's one thing that you can get from this post - it's that despite any issues you've had after entering \"the real world\", you can overcome them (or learn to let go of them).\n\nHere are some resources that really helped me out.   \nMindset: The New Psychology of Success - Prof Carol Dweck.  This books was written pretty much for almost everyone in r/aftergifted.  For some of us, being in the \"gifted\" program became part of our identity, and that meant if you failed, deep down maybe that meant you were no longer gifted or smart.  Unconsciously, you picked up a fear of failure, or fear of looking stupid in front of your peers or supervisors.  This book tells you how to develop a new mindset.\n\n[https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) \\- Amazing course by Barbara Oakley,  of Oakland University.

If you have, you probably noticed something -- all of the reviews are positive. There are almost no negative reviews! That\u2019s not necessarily a good thing, as too many good reviews can lead to skepticism. Chris decided to explore this issue in his recent article, [Why Don\u2019t We Get Negative Reviews?](https://medium.com/launch-school/why-dont-we-get-negative-reviews-e6d9e643b050). Check it out.\n\n## Chatting with Dr. Barbara Oakley\n\nIt\u2019s a new season -- our 3rd -- for the Launch School Podcast! The new season opens with a conversation with someone who should be familiar to most Launch School Students. It\u2019s Dr. Barbara Oakley, the creator and instructor for Coursera\u2019s [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) course.\n\nThere\u2019s also something different about this Podcast -- the Podcast is led by Launch School students Jenae and Mandy! They were clearly having a lot of fun!\n\n## Articles and Projects\n\nOur students have been keeping busy. We\u2019ve got Show &amp; Tell projects as well as some interesting articles. Let\u2019s see who did what.\n\nElie gets us started with his article [Why Launch School \u2014 Detailed review](https://elieasmar89.medium.com/why-launch-school-detailed-review-c45e27c6b782). He starts out by describing the path that led him to Launch School and then wraps things up by talking about why he chose us. If you\u2019re still considering Launch School, this article may be just what you need to help you decide.\n\nIn his career, Gene wants to solve problems that help people. That led him to [Changing Careers 2 Years After College](https://medium.com/launch-school/changing-careers-2-years-after-college-a843c093f24). Right after graduation, he realized he was in the wrong profession. He walks us through how he decided to choose software engineering and ended up at Launch School.\n\nDavid wanted to be sure that he wouldn\u2019t forget anything essential while taking a written assessment, so he came up with his [Checklist for Launch in 3\u20262\u20261\u2026](https://davidecklund.medium.com/checklist-for-launch-in-3-2-1-a4d013a52be). He thinks his checklist may help others handle the assessments. We agree, especially for that first 109 exam.\n\nOur Show and Tell begins with Dylan\u2019s optional JS175 project, a simple adaption of a board game called Jacynth. After participating in our Peer-Led Seminar on TypeScript, he decided to rewrite it using TypeScript, and he\u2019s now made it and the source code available. [Check it out here!](https://launchschool.com/posts/5c28e7c6)\n\nMarc wanted to work on a project after completing JS185 and settled on something he knows he\u2019ll use: an RSVP manager for weekly events. It\u2019s multilingual (German and English) and easy to use. It\u2019s got a little ways to go, but it\u2019ll be interesting to follow along and see how Marc enhances it going forward.\n\nWe also have an article by former student and Capstone grad, Sunny. It could be a bit controversial, but he wants us and the world to know that [Yes, Personal Projects are Work Experience](https://betterprogramming.pub/yes-personal-projects-are-work-experience-1bf2f129d787). One way or the other, it's definitely of interest to many of our students.\n\nOur community continues to impress with its articles and projects.\n\nWriting is a great way to help you learn new material, and it can also help your fellow students learn. Whether it\u2019s a technical article, some study tips, or a discussion of your experience with LS assessments, think about writing it up. Once you do, post it to our [Sharing Page](https://launchschool.com/social)! We give Launch School cash credit for articles accepted in our [Medium publication](https://medium.com/launch-school).\n\n## Tech Talks\n\nGooi recently held a tech talk about [Channels and Concurrency](https://launchschool.com/posts/1aec0302). His presentation provides a basic overview of why channels are important when managing complex concurrent operations. You can watch it at the above link.\n\nAnother great way to solidify your understanding and help others learn is to give a presentation. We offer a $200 credit for Tech Talk presentations. Do you have an idea for a Tech Talk?

We\u2019ve been tweaking the schedules a bit so that more students can attend when it\u2019s convenient for them, so keep an eye on the [Study Groups Forum](https://launchschool.com/forum?tab=Study+Groups) for announcements of upcoming sessions.\n\nAs usual, [\\#the-spot](https://launchschool.slack.com/archives/C017H333RDM) continues to do great work running study sessions for all of our courses. It\u2019s great seeing our students giving back by running their own study groups and filling a need!\n\nThe [Launch School Women\u2019s Group](https://launchschool.com/posts/f0a1e42d) next monthly meetup is on Sunday, **July 18th at 12 Noon US Eastern Time**. This month\u2019s Focused Discussion is to be announced later. However, they\u2019ll still have their usual program of socializing and asking questions.\n\nAll events are free, though most have limited seating availability. Monitor the [Forum\u2019s Study Groups tab](https://launchschool.com/forum?tab=Study+Groups) for new Study Groups, and watch the [General Forum](https://launchschool.com/forum?tab=General) for news of other future events.\n\n## That\u2019s All for Now\n\nSee you around! Stay healthy and safe, and have a fun Summer! Don\u2019t forget to pet your dogs and cats (and any other critters you may have), and keep them cool in the heat as well.\n\nArchives for the Community Updates can be found on the Resources tab.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "launchschool", "subreddit_id": "t5_3kflqd", "subreddit_subscribers": 474, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Community Update - July 1, 2021", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/launchschool/comments/oc42hx/community_update_july_1_2021/", "created": 1625205804.0}]
