Sitting down with your guitar (or instrument of choice) and some songs and playing them and puzzling out the parts was a practice that helped me a lot.

The playing-by-ear practice I mentioned above can help you to internalize a lot of this information, but, learning from my own mistakes, I would say try to learn the theory and the by-ear applications. I can figure out the chords, but I also may end up sitting there for a while, singing the melody and going through some chords through trial-and-error. It works, but it's time-consuming, and theory can give you some shortcuts because you know x chord often goes with y chord, or you would hear thay x-y relationship right together.\n\nYou can definitely sit down and learn all types of scales through sheet music or tab, but I think playing to some songs, figuring them out, and then being able to apply them is way more useful, personally.\n\nCheck out Coursera's music courses, too.

It's a reasoned judgement drawn from relentless observation. If someone developed a better epistemology - for example, if they uncovered an ancient god of knowledge who would grant you learning in some subject equivalent to a PhD from the year 9999 CE so long as you sacrificed a goat, you better believe I'd sacrifice a fucking goat.\n\nSince nothing like that exists, and since non-data-driven methods are proven to not work... here I must stand, for I can do no other. To paraphrase Martin Luther.\n\n&gt; Someone has to have some subjective-logic based hypothesis which builds past the current scaffolding of objective logic,rules or principles .\n\nIn fact, with nearly overwhelming certainty, that turns out not to be the case. A hypothesis is, formally, a mathematical structure that explains some facet of reality. We traditionally think of physical reality, but these structures can be applied to arbitrary facets of reality. All computer programs, for example, can be fully described by a kind of math called lambda calculus. So old-style (non-ML) machine translation systems that were programmed by humans can be reduced to that spare and beautiful language, even if written in a programming language with syntax that feels almost like english - such as python. \n\nNow, machine translators encode a hypothesis of the target language. If you want to translate something to welsh, the translator has to know how to interpolate that language to welsh. It therefore has to know the rules that welsh obeys. A model of welsh, if you will.\n\nMachine learning is a technological process that can generate hypotheses - models - of arbitrary data through *purely* mathematical means. It's a bit involved, and you need to understand a just a bit of linear algebra and multivariate calculus to get the intuition for how it works. Take me on my word that humans are not a necessary part of creating a hypothesis. Or dont - [here's a link to a free course on the basics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).\n\nRecently, a group called OpenAI recently created a hypothesis of english language called GPT-2. [Some info.](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/) Notably, this hypothesis of english was created by machine learning - by a computer using purely mathematical techniques - the text on the other side of every single link on reddit that went to an english site with at least three upvotes was what the computer studied, to generate the model. \n\nMath can use nothing but objective information to create a model of english so detailed that when given this human-written prompt:\n\n&gt; A train carriage containing controlled nuclear materials was stolen in Cincinnati today. Its whereabouts are unknown.\n\nThe model produced this completion:\n\n&gt;The incident occurred on the downtown train line, which runs from Covington and Ashland stations.\n\n&gt;In an email to Ohio news outlets, the U.S. Department of Energy said it is working with the Federal Railroad Administration to find the thief.\n\n&gt;\u201cThe theft of this nuclear material will have significant negative consequences on public and environmental health, our workforce and the economy of our nation,\u201d said Tom Hicks, the U.S. Energy Secretary, in a statement. \u201cOur top priority is to secure the theft and ensure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\n&gt;The stolen material was taken from the University of Cincinnati\u2019s Research Triangle Park nuclear research site, according to a news release from Department officials.\n\n&gt;The Nuclear Regulatory Commission did not immediately release any information.\n\n&gt;According to the release, the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Security is leading that team\u2019s investigation.\n\n&gt;\u201cThe safety of people, the environment and the nation\u2019s nuclear stockpile is our highest priority,\u201d Hicks said. \u201cWe will get to the bottom of this and make no excuses.\n\nPersonally, I find that language is the most subjective thing in existence. There's so much ambiguity. So much room for interpretation. But as GPT-2 shows, in actuality, a nearly-complete objective model of english can be made by purely mathematical techniques. No human subjectivity needs to intercede there; and if that falls, it's to believe that anything else is safe from these techniques.\n\nCurrently, there exist systems to create new mathematical theorems automatically each theorem is a tool that allows new statements to be evaluated as absolutely true or false, or as inherently unknowable - these are classical programs, and they work by brute force, like the old chess engines once did.\n\nCurrently, ML models score about a C on basic algebra. But here's the thing - while we needed a stupid amount of human-generated information for math to make an almost perfect model of english in the form of an unfathomably complex mathematical function... mathematical expressions can be generated in *arbitrary* quantities by computer programs. The training corpus of an ML mathematician is... infinite. Math will teach itself math; it will use it's understanding to further its understanding. It will make deductions that only humans could make before.\n\nAlphaGo was also a ML model. Prior to its creation, subjective human determinations reigned supreme in the game of go. Prior to ML, nobody thought that computer programs for playing Go would ever challenge a serious player. In a series of five games, AlphaGo *destroyed* Lee Sedol, one of the greatest grandmasters of the game.\n\nQualia are a beautiful thing. They are what let us see and understand the world, and have conscious experience. The subjective locus of self called \"I\". But *every* drip and dreg of evidence that exists these days all but screams they are not *necessary*. Only... present. And so often a distraction from what is really the truth.\n\nI'm not saying to ignore subjectivity. Hell, *I* don't live without it. I write fiction, if not for a living, at least for passion, and it's a valuable tool there. I just exclude it from my reasoning about reality, because, really - it's *not* made for that.

Unemployment is low so developers shouldn't have too much of an issue finding a job.\n\n&gt; ... how does someone who's just starting get a job doing this?\n\nThis really depends on the experience level. Someone with absolutely **no experience** should spend several months learning before applying. Check [this out](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2600/1*1SeaZ5ceDWT_L6KesFAXiQ.png) to get an idea of what language to should learn. \n\nLet's say web-development was chosen. Here's the order of operations I would recommend:\n\n- **HTML**: \n - The first thing to learn is very basic HTML. HTML defines what is shown on the website (buttons, images, tables...). If you can figure out how to show an image on a screen using HTML that's perfect for now. [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) is a great resource for this.\n - Estimate time: 1 hour to a few days to get comfortable.\n- **JavaScript**\n - Next is JavaScript. JavaScript defines what happens when you hit a button, submit forms, etc. This is your bread and butter and your entire career will be focused around this. You are going to continually be learning about this one for the rest of your career. For starters, I recommend a good series like the [Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoSksQ4s_hg&amp;list=PL4cUxeGkcC9i9Ae2D9Ee1RvylH38dKuET) or a free course through [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers?)\n - Estimated time: 3-7 months to get comfortable.  \n- **CSS**\n - Last of the major ones is CSS. CSS makes the stuff in the HTML look pretty. You will continuously mess this one up then wonder why the hell your box isn't showing up where you want it to. [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) is a great resource for this.\n - Estimated time: 1 hour to a few days to get comfortable.\n\n**Everything above is needed. Everything below starts is optional but are all pretty common terms to see on job descriptions. There is no order you should follow here**\n\n- **JavaScript Frameworks/ Libraries**:\n - All of these are optional. Think of them as Add-ons to JavaScript that make your life easier. A few of the major ones are JQuery, Angular and React. [Codevolution](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC80PWRj_ZU8Zu0HSMNVwKWw/playlists) and the [Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg/playlists) have great tutorials on these. HTML\n - Estimate time: Depends on what you are learning. A few days for Jquery, a week for React and 3 weeks for Angular.\n- NodeJS\n - This is only needed if you are doing back-end development. You write this in JavaScript and it defines what happens on the websites server like who has access to what information, security, storage, etc. And again, [Codevolution](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC3y8-rFHvwhco_O8PS1iS9xRrdVTvSIz) and the [Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gcy9lrvMJ75z9maRw4byYp) are great resources for this.\n - Estimated time: 1 month to get comfortable.\n- **Git**\n - Git isn't necessary but it is an industry standard so you will have to learn it eventually. Git is like the Google Docs of programming. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project without getting in each others way. This will be your portfolio when looking for jobs. Put all your projects here. Even the smallest ones. You will need this in lieu of work experience or a 4-year degree. I don't have any great resources to learn this one, sorry.\n - Estimated time: A few days to get comfortable.\n\n\nThat's a lot of things you need to learn but the nice thing is that there is a lot of overlap so when you learn CSS you also learn HTML. When you learn a JavaScript library, you get better at JavaScript. If you learn JavaScript you're more than halfway done learning NodeJS. All in all, if someone is dedicated, they can get proficient enough in 6 months. To get a job, you will most likely need a GitHub portfolio with a few projects you made that you can show off. They don't need to be fancy, just something you can talk about during an interview. Contributing to open-source projects (Github projects that random people can help out on) can go a long ways during an interview. Helping to fix a few minor bugs that someone reported should be more than enough. Then, just keep sending out applications until someone bites. If you see a lot of job descriptions asking for something you don't know, consider adding it to your arsenal of tools.

I would recommend you approach the process in waves.  The process I would recommend is as follows:\n\n1. Octave is very useful for understanding the math behind what is going on and is very math focused (it's basically the opensource version of Matlab).  It allows you to develop a deep understanding of the math behind the networks, without having to worry about package management, path issues, version control, virtual environments and all the other stuff that is relatively important in python.  For Andrew's first course (which I highly recommend), I'd use Octave.    \n2. If you are still interested in this whole deep learning thing after completing Andrew's first course, I'd follow that up with a decent python/programming intro.  Python is pretty much the de-facto. language for most DL practitioners For general programming with python. I'd run through the University of Toronto Coursera course:  [Learn To Program: The Fundamentals](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learn-to-program) to learn the basics of programming and maybe do one of the [RealPython.com](https://RealPython.com) classes/books (Real Python Basics is pretty good for getting you up to speed quickly).  While you are getting familiar with python you might as well get your dev environment stood up:\n   1. During this period of time it would be valuable to setup a general IDE/text\\_editor.  For a variety of reasons, I chose to use vim as my IDE.  There are a lot of details why I chose vim, which you can read [here](https://github.com/2EZXIII/josiahs_vim). \n   2. Also now would be a good time to get in bed with Ubuntu 18.04 if you have not already.  It is true that you can use a mac for a lot of development work, but if you ever deploy your models, you will most likely be using some flavor of linux (everything I have done thus far in the DL world has been on Ubuntu).  Download it on your laptop, if at all possible start using it exclusively.  A warning, when getting started with Linux, avoid the temptation to install \"cool\" software, if it looks sexy I'd recommend avoiding it.  Stick with your python packages, IDE and IDE Plugins (in my case VIM, Vundle, and git), and USE THE COMMAND LINE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.  This should reduce the number of times you have to reinstall ubuntu.....which we all have had to do because....well sometimes apps are just too hard to resist.\n      1. Note an alternative to the laptop would be to fire up an AWS or other cloud based server and just SSH into it.  One thing that is nice about my recommended config is that it all will work on both your laptop or in the cloud via ssh.\n   3. Setup a github account (which is a web app) and install git (which is an app that runs on your server or laptop).  James chambers has a good write-up on git workflows [here](https://jameschambers.co/writing/git-team-workflow-cheatsheet/).  Don't feel like an idiot, when first using git, none of us really understand exactly how it works, it lies somewhere between complete understanding of gradient descent and a unified theory of everything.\n3. Once you are done with the above circle back and take Andrew's [deeplearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai) course.  During this time I would implement your own small python module that you can call that allows you to implement all the various models from scratch (ok, you will be allowed to use numpy), that should make you familiar with how all the math works and how to program the different functions.  Don't stress over this module, it is for learning purposes only, and you most likely won't use it in real life unless you are fiddling around with toy problems or researching your own ideas, but this worked for me.\n4.
