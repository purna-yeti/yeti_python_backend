Maybe you just need to choose a specific timeslot for your formal journaling in your evening routine, to make it easier to build this second habit. And keep your journaling notebook in a very visible place, if possible, as a visual trigger for the habit.\n\n**#2** Are you sure you are getting the most from your morning pages? You said that your morning pages are \"mostly trash\", but my experience is quite different. I always end up generating very valuable insights by the end of my freewriting session (my perfect session length is 30-45min), and use some signifiers during my session *(a checkbox for an obvious todo item, underlining/circling for important insights)* so that, after the session, it was easy to quickly transfer the truly valuable stuff where it belongs (a todo list for the day, \"key lessons/insights about the day\" section in the daily entry in my bullet journal, weekly/monthly review checklists, etc.).\n\n**#3** If your days are quite empty, maybe you just don't have enough material for your evening journaling session. In such case, you could try brainstorming the skills you want to build/improve &amp; why, and figuring out short doable sprints for making that happen ([here is a how-to](https://medium.com/better-humans/how-to-break-down-your-goals-into-sprints-689af9e97c52)). And then you'd have some material for a learning journal, at least (writing about what you learn improves the quality of your learning \u2014 I saw it recommended in some textbook first &amp; then experienced myself).\n\nOne of the easiest things in that realm is to take some free MOOC courses. E.g. Coursera has courses by the best universities of the world; most of them are free at least in Audit Mode &amp; some are free even in a full mode (that's when you can submit assignments &amp; do peer reviews).

If you're just looking to get deeper into javascript, start off by learning how to load and process data with the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) and XMLHttpRequest/axios. Learn how to work with apis, and take a look at [Google's api explorer](https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer). I think the most approachable api I've seen recently is [https://newsapi.org/](https://newsapi.org/). For me personally, learning how to utilize apis was probably the biggest hurdle I had to deal with when I got started, but once you have that down, then you'll be able to do any number of neat things, like payment processing with PayPal or Stripes payment apis, content loading, such as in a professional setting where you rely on your own apis to process and pull user data, or just general tasks like email or sms. Additionally, learn how to do dom manipulation and learn how to do it well. Whenever I wanted to dynamically add content to page when i first got started, I would use `document.getElementById(\"somediv\").innerHTML += \"&lt;div&gt;This is dynamically loaded&lt;/div&gt;\"`. Overall not the best idea. Learn how to use [document.createElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement) and the other dom node creation functions. When I started getting into backend development I began with php (again thenewbostons videos on this are pretty solid). PHP makes it very easy to get started with things like database querys and handling get and post data through form input, and once you have that stuff down conceptually, the transition to writing your own apis in node or python becomes much easier. My last recommendation would be to learn about some frontend frameworks. I personally like to use [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), but ultimately pick whatever you think will be easiest to get into and most applicable for you. That being said, im not a fan of having people get started with web development by jumping into a framework, because in order to understand why these frameworks exist and what problems they're trying to solve, its important to know the underlying languages first.

He's got great, no nonsense tutorials, neat free stuff, and he's featured regularly on Ableton's own site, which is an invaluable resource unto itself.\n\nCheck out the many [free courses from Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/search?query=ableton&amp;) on music production from top-tier accredited institutions. ALL classes on their site have the option to be audited for free, even though they really want your money; you just won't get a certificate of completion, or access to certain assignments and tests. Courses are typically grouped into tracks, which appear to only offer paid plans, so you MUST go to a course's individual page in order to find the audit option.  [Here is a link to their Intro to Live course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ableton-live) from Berkley, which is super beginner friendly. Personally, I have learned a tremendous amount over the years on this site from top universities on subjects as wide ranging as coding and web design, entrepreneurship, philosophy, medieval manuscript preservation (yeah, I'm weird), linguistics, and much much more, so it's also a great general resource for learning, period.\n\nSlynk's YouTube channel is a great resource, as other's have said. He has a great [tutorial on simpler and sampler](https://youtu.be/ef-p0-NF7Vs) that will give you a hint at some of the neat stuff live can do.\n\nSince everyone is rightfully saying YouTube is a great resource, I'll also suggest searching for your favorite producers in general because there are so many out there that have videos featuring song creation techniques, signal chains, and workflow advice that aren't explicitly tutorials, per se. Don't be turned off if they're using another DAW because it can be a fun challenge to figure out how replicate whatever they're doing in Ableton.\n\nAnother thing you should do is check out the various free synths and plugins out there before plunking down cash on ANYTHING. Be patient and learn how to use your tools properly before going crazy with VSTs. There are SO MANY articles out there on free synths and they are easy to find, but they might have some small quirks, such as [Helm](https://tytel.org/helm/) (super great, but I have my gripes), and [the PG-8X](https://sites.google.com/site/mlvst0/) (which sounds AMAZING, but is a pain to install properly on a Mac and you have to download the presets separately, as well as load them in from the file browser every time you fire it up). [Synth1](https://www.kvraudio.com/product/synth1-by-daichi-laboratory-ichiro-toda) is another great option and if you look around a bit there's a zip file floating around out there with 25,000+ presets (it is also a pain to set up, but worth it). For most free synths you'll need to learn how to install VSTs (not difficult), and be aware that if you have a Mac the OS will try to reject most of them, which you can remedy by going into your System Preferences under Security &amp; Privacy and clicking \"Allow,\" sometimes several times in a row. And don't forget to hit \"Rescan\" in your Ableton preferences if it happens to be open during any installations.\n\nI'll also recommend Valhalla's [Supermassive](https://valhalladsp.com/shop/reverb/valhalla-supermassive/) because it JUST released, It is amazing, and it's free. Reverb/delay heaven.\n\nIf you must spend your hard-earned cash, Serum is totally worth it, and there's a $9.99/month rent-to-own plan. There are folks that would vehemently advise against the RTO purchase model for VSTs, and for legitimate reason, but if you're strapped it is an option.\n\nHere's some things not to do:\n\nDon't get caught up in too many RTO plans. If you wan't to pay $50+ a month for a handful of VSTs, go for it. But you probably shouldn't.\n\nDon't develop DAW envy. Sure, you just got Suite, but believe me, this is real. Live isn't the only game in town. You might see other producer's using Logic or FL Studio or whatever to great effect. Having multiple DAWs can be great, but it's also expensive, both from a monetary and time/learning perspective. Get a handle on what you have first. Live is so deep it will make your head spin, repeatedly, and if it's not having that effect, you either need to experiment more, or find better tutorials.\n\nDon't let frustration get the better of you. For the most part, whatever you want to do can be done in Live. But, for many, the learning curve is steep. Others have said read the manual. Do that. If you want to master Live, the manual is not optional.\n\nDon't fall down the sample pack/preset rabbit hole. There is an entire universe of amazing samples and presets out there, but Live is already chocked full of great stuff. The demo tracks for these sorts of things can be very seductive, but be warned, you're basically being sold the promise that you too will sound just as slick and polished, or even better. What they don't tell you is that without knowing the production techniques, good luck at even coming close to the demo; many of the presets and samples won't sound great on their own without some help from effects or layering or whatever they used; however, there are quality packs out there that include project files for their demos, and these can provide an excellent opportunity to deconstruct everything they've done to get the sounds that appeal to you. I'm not saying never buy sample packs or presets, just don't get trigger happy, and, as ever, learn what you have before moving forward. Also, when you do inevitably pay for presets, it's useful to reverse engineer them to see how they were made so that you can start to make your own.\n\nDon't be too persuaded by producers that preach formula over creativity. Music with wide appeal can most certainly be reduced to a set of interchangeable variables that will do the trick almost every time, if you know what you're doing. But if you want to keep yourself interested you'll most likely need a certain amount of innovation in your music making, so experiment constantly. If you're in it for money, then, yes, by all means learn the \"shortcuts,\" but don't be fooled that there's a short way around to truly great music. It all depends on your expectations. Personally, I value creativity above above everything, which does admittedly involve a fair degree of emulation, so I spend my time evenly between experimenting and figuring out how other producers created sounds I really like. But don't be caught up in purest ideology either. It's ok to be in it for the money. It's ok to be in it for fun. And it's ok to be in it for both.\n\nAnd finally, don't let tutorials be the end all go to for developing who you are as a producer. The incredibly prolific producer Savant [once said](https://youtu.be/SyXMhf0NbOU), \"watch tutorials, sound like everyone else.\" I'm not his biggest fan, but I respect what he does, and, in a sea of sound-alikes, he keeps his sound evolving. Also, it's ok to sound like others if that's your thing. Bottom line, do what YOU want to do.\n\nSome of the above advice is rudimentary, so forgive me if it's too simplistic or obvious, or others have already said as much.\n\nGood luck with Ableton Live, and, more than anything, have fun!", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1590259963, "edited": 1590260566.0, "gildings": {}, "id": "frkntd9", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gp2625", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_gp2625", "permalink": "/r/ableton/comments/gp2625/so_i_bought_ableton_suite_what_next/frkntd9/", "retrieved_on": 1590260868, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ableton", "subreddit_id": "t5_2re1a", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1590259963.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "Dietzgen17", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ims8kr5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "When I was at Harvard, there was an institution called the Bureau of Study Counsel, which provided therapy and tutoring, I saw a counselor there.

I didn't read it until many years after graduating, but it was pretty useful.

IDeas of limits, derivatives, and integrals are not hard to understand, and in my experience, most students understand these. Students apply these ideas in problems, and then they do not know algebra or make a simple mistake that messes up everything. Here are my suggestions for you.\n\n1) First, nobody is bad at anything. So, get this idea of not being good at math out of your mind. Everybody can learn. It just takes practice and dedication. You should take this course or audit for free [https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)\n\n2) You need to know real number systems, equations, and inequalities. After that, learn about functions including algebraic, rational, exponential, trigonometric, logarithmic functions. Learn also about domain and range of functions and graphing functions. Any good text on Algebra or Precalc will have all of these. \n\n3) Know your Algebraic and Trig identities.\n\nNobody can be 100% ready to do a new thing. So be prepared to go back and reread or google the new term you come across. Calculus textbooks used by US universities are usually very good. Make a habit of reading your Calculus textbook regularly before the lecture. \n\nWhenever you have a Math problem in front of you, do not look for a solution online or in a solution manual or your calculator. Sit down with a pen and a paper and work out yourself. If you have done the reading and know basics, you will be able to do the problem eventually. If you have no clue at all, reach out to your professor or TA for a quick hint (not the solution). This process will teach you critical problem-solving skills you need later for your job. \n\nSo far, millions and millions of people have done calculus, and you can do it too.

I would just recommend going to [Study.com](https://study.com/) route. I took care of my mom for a few years, with the intention of getting a CS degree eventually. I always loved to code, and have made projects using the MERN stack, MongoDB, Express, React and Node. I have also helped on a project or two using C++, so while I have not been paid to be a programmer, its something I have loved to do and wanted to do for at least half my life now, so the determination is there and I finally have the chance to do this.\n\nI personally feel that you have to really love coding, not just the potential salary. There are other ways to make good money. Also, it is not just WGU, I have friends that have gone to other colleges that have shared their experiences with me. No college/coding boot camp etc. is going to teach you how to code, they can maybe give you the training wheels to start, but if you think you can sit in a classroom for an hour a day and now you \"know it\", or will ever 100% know it that's not the case.\n\nYou will always be learning, struggling to solve problems and always trying to be better than you were yesterday, that's the beauty of this job. It is never too late to start, and you will always never know enough. I know folks that have been in this industry years that confided in me that they sometimes still cry in private over how hard a problem was to solve. Or are the star of their team at work, but still worry that this might be the problem that makes them have to look for a new job.\n\nI recommend you go on Udemy, do some beginner programming courses, put together some projects. Coursera is great. Udacity has some free stuff that's good. Get in the habit of teaching yourself. Look up how to do things bit by bit and get faster at it.\n\n[https://www.coursera.org/](https://www.coursera.org/)\n\n[https://www.udemy.com/](https://www.udemy.com/)\n\nIf you find that you like this. I would recommend going on the Study.com route. I started with WGU Academy and found the free textbooks that they give you to be lacking. My husband who is a math major from the University of Texas at Austin (pretty good school) and used to be a textbook editor, found the textbooks provided to be awful and not newbie-friendly. Most courses on Study.com have videos, and every one of them has well put together reading. I am taking their Java course right now, but it is very intro so I am also doing additional outside projects/videos/reading so that I can aim to get an internship this Fall. That is how you will do well, additional outside projects and ideally an internship. I hope all of this helps! You can do it.\n\n[Study.com WGU Transfer Guide](https://partners.wgu.edu/Pages/Single.aspx?aid=19142&amp;pid=86)\n\n[Course order recommendation post if you are new to computer science](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/au0hq5/course_order_recommendation_if_youre_new_to/)  \n\"  \n\n\nPs. Outside of this response when I should add that when I am not taking classes for school, I am learning to code in Java and Python. I highly recommend learning using some of Tim Buchalka's Udemy courses.  \n\n\n I recently have been honored with an online Machine Learning Internship this Summer, and I earned it based on what I know and what I showed promise in being able to pick up quickly. This is all do-able, but I should warn you that even before the Coronavirus, I barely saw my friends, even now, I don't have time to see them on video. I learn, relax a bit, and then get back to work/learning.   \n\n\nJust like with any college course, you can go in with no prior knowledge and pass if you try hard enough and are willing to study using outside resources and extra energy.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1589430882, "gildings": {}, "id": "fqkmu9e", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_giqv2j", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_fqkj6j5", "permalink": "/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/giqv2j/all_credits_needed_recommended_course_schedule/fqkmu9e/", "retrieved_on": 1589438741, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "WGU_CompSci", "subreddit_id": "t5_gsr7a", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1589430882.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "Generic_DummyFucker", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4dmlelni", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1589423596, "gildings": {}, "id": "fqkazca", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gj9d9p", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_fqk5w6i", "permalink": "/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/gj9d9p/today_i_got_a_4_on_a_final_and_realized_i_have/fqkazca/", "retrieved_on": 1589432801, "score": 3, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "EngineeringStudents", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sh0b", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1589423596.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "graceg222", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": "noflair", "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "52a4dae2-6c35-11e9-81f1-0acf30770a48", "author_flair_text": "New", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6abqccgv", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "I suggest learning about how the human body responds to various food, educate yourself to motivate the change\n\nThere's a free course on coursera which I found really interesting - goes through your body responses to foods and how the ideal balance should look: [https://www.coursera.org/learn/weight-management-beyond-balancing-calories](https://www.coursera.org/learn/weight-management-beyond-balancing-calories)", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1589315440, "gildings": {}, "id": "fqexycu", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gi5gag", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_gi5gag", "permalink": "/r/loseit/comments/gi5gag/looking_for_advice_im_a_beginner_who_has_never/fqexycu/", "retrieved_on": 1589322471, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "loseit", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rz8w", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1589315440.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "Maushi_chi_band", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_12sb9i7h", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "You forgot to provide most imp bit of info: \"where are you located\"?\n\nAssuming that you are located in india - I suggest you complete your degree.

For context - I have a master's degree in Economics and made the break into a Data Science role a few years ago. The way I'd break down how you approach the job hunt is into three categories - Technical Skills, Data Science Skills, and Positioning.\n\n**Technical Skills** \\- Most Data Science roles out there require knowledge of Python on SQL. R is rarely used in production settings so I'd be biased to ramping up on Python if you're not on that path already. I taught myself enough python to scrape by interviews using this specialization on Coursera specialization - [https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python). Since you've already worked in STATA and R - it's just a matter of figuring out how the syntax works and this specialization is super hands-on so it gives you just what you need. I learnt SQL in a weekend - it sounds like an intimidating thing to do, but it's nothing you can't do if you got yourself through a masters degree in economics. Do all the tutorials on here ([https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL\\_Tutorial](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial)) and you can add to your resume in a week.\n\n**Data Science Skills** \\- This is two-fold - ML algorithms and the ability to work smartly with data. I think the latter is a skill you already have if you are able to clean data and come up with a Fixed Effects model and make a thesis of it. In terms of ML algorithms - what I found most confidence-inspiring when I was trying to learn this stuff is starting from first principles. All the fancy buzz words in DS (Neural Networks, Regularization - you have it) can be mapped back to mathematical concepts that underpin a linear regression that you already have from Econometrics classes. For instance a Logistic Regression - the core building block of a Neural network for a classification task is the Probit and Logit models that you already have to have done in an Econometrics class. A lot of data scientists have no idea what they're doing from a mathematical standpoint when they are trying out DS algorithms and you have an advantage here. Long story short - find connections between what you already know and what is Machine Learning and learn all the buzz words. Trust me, you already know a lot of this stuff.\n\n**Positioning -** As someone with a masters degree in Economics you already come with a lot of the skills required to be a good Data Scientist. You need to sell your skills in a way that is attractive to people in Industry. For instance - what most of Econometrics boils down to is finding smart ways to work with data and assumptions to arrive at the causal effect of an intervention on an outcome variable (Causal Inference). Take the fixed effects thesis for example - reframe it as working with observational data to arrive at a causal interpretation of an intervention. You need to speak industry language - not many people know what Fixed Effects is, so tell them what they want to hear. For example, you could sell yourself as someone who can work with observational data to prove causal interpretation of an intervention. Experimentation is another area where an Economics background is particularly helpful - talk about this. Natural experiments happen all the time and companies have data about it, talk about how you know what to do with a natural experiment. Econometrics + Machine Learning has a lot of research happening right now, Susan Athey at Stanford is at the forefront of this and her papers will give you good ideas as to how to blend the two disciplines.\n\nWell, that was a long answer. As an Economist, you come with the right-thinking required to get a job in Data Science. Ramp up on technical skills - it should take you a month of dedicated studying. While prepping on the technical side start reaching out to people on LinkedIn - 'Economist + Data Science' in the search bar is a good place to start. In addition to online applications, talking to other people is a great way to get yourself a referral and jump the usual online application/rejection cycle (this is what worked for me in the end). As with most DS jobs you will learn most things on the job - so demonstrate a willingness in these conversations to want to ramp up on SWE skills which are required in the real world for sure\n\nHang in there - with a little more work and time I'm confident you'll be successful.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1589068385, "edited": 1589068573.0, "gildings": {}, "id": "fq3o8lx", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ggojki", "locked": false, "no_follow": false, "parent_id": "t3_ggojki", "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/ggojki/how_do_i_get_out_of_the_circle_of_i_need/fq3o8lx/", "retrieved_on": 1589082030, "score": 91, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "datascience", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "total_awards_received": 1, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1589068385.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "JacksonRiver", "author_flair_background_color": "#51000e", "author_flair_css_class": "toscana", "author_flair_richtext": [{"a": ":toscana:", "e": "emoji", "u": "https://emoji.redditmedia.com/vq8w081wy2y31_t5_2qkhk/toscana"}, {"e": "text", "t": " Toscana"}], "author_flair_template_id": "dea01fd4-af3f-11e7-944f-0e5a4d768d6e", "author_flair_text": ":toscana: Toscana", "author_flair_text_color": "light", "author_flair_type": "richtext", "author_fullname": "t2_3mzjexnl", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Me la immagino cos\u00ec: tavola rotonda e gli invitati in questo ordine.\n\n  \nA moderare: **Anthony Magnabosco**\n\nAd alternare momenti di apparente seriet\u00e0 e momenti di clowning: **LeBron James**\n\nA riflettere e rimescolare: **Barbara Oakley**\n\nA discutere e intrattenere: **Dan Ariely**\n\nA suonare qualcosa: **Jacob Collier**\n\nA cercare di assorbire ci\u00f2 che viene detto con espressione meditativa: **Josh Radnor**\n\nA discutere e intrattenere: **Robert Sapolsky**\n\nWild card: **Jennifer Lawrence**\n\nA stare calmo sempre: **Sam Harris**\n\nWild card: **Evan Peters**\n\n**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**\n\n**Anthony Magnabosco** perch\u00e9 grazie a lui ho scoperto [un metodo](https://www.streetepistemology.com/) molto importante e penso che sarebbe molto piacevole averlo come ospite.\n\n**LeBron James** beh, perch\u00e9 \u00e8 LeBron James.\n\n**Barbara Oakley** perch\u00e9 con il suo [corso](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) ha contribuito a cambiarmi la vita.\n\n**Dan Ariely** perch\u00e9 lo vorrei sentire ragionare con Sapolsky.\n\n**Jacob Collier** perch\u00e9 mi sembra estremamente interessante.\n\n**Josh Radnor** perch\u00e9 vorrei conoscere la persona dietro Ted Mosby.\n\n**Robert Sapolsky** perch\u00e9 lo vorrei sentire ragionare di libero arbitrio e comportamento.\n\n**Jennifer Lawrence** perch\u00e9 sarei curioso di vedere che tipa \u00e8 nella realt\u00e0.\n\n**Sam Harris** perch\u00e9 lo vorrei sentire ragionare e sarebbe anche di grande aiuto nella moderazione.\n\n**Evan Peters** perch\u00e9 sarei curioso di vedere com'\u00e8 dal vivo.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1589037256, "gildings": {}, "id": "fq0t0wj", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gga9l1", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_gga9l1", "permalink": "/r/italy/comments/gga9l1/giochinocuriosit\u00e0_una_tavolata_con_dieci_persone/fq0t0wj/", "retrieved_on": 1589037591, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "italy", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qkhk", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1589037256.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "hellowings", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_rctve", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "10 rules of good studying &amp;

That's a very different set of skills focusing on networking and devops.\n\nIf you're completely new to programming, then the first thing you need behind your belt is to learn computational thinking, i.e. how to think like a programmer. The computer language is less important at this stage, typically most introductory courses will start you in Python or Java. That said I'd avoid diving into Haskell, Plutus or Marlowe just yet. There is the [Plutus playground](https://prod.playground.plutus.iohkdev.io/) for learning smart contracts on Cardano, but personally I think if you're completely new to programming, this will just turn overwhelm you. You need to be able to think computationally and then understand the basic constructs first.\n\nFind a resource that you click with. You'll typically learn the most when the material involves some kind of project. I'd avoid using materials that just take you step by step through a language like code academy. Whilst nice, you'll find it will quickly be forgotten. Here are some resources I'd recommend:\n\n[https://www.edx.org/](https://www.edx.org/) is site that's teamed up with Ivy league universities like MIT and Harvard to make their courses open source and you'll therefore find high quality and structured material here. You should start with something like [MIT's introduction to computer science and programming](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7).\n\nI the following sites are all very good, I'm not going to search through all of them for you.

I imagine you could get an analyst job with just the DS 100 stuff, but honestly I can't say for sure.\n\nI would say CS 189 is probably more theory than we looked for.  If you know how to implement most of the major algorithms from scratch, that should be enough.  (Not as hard as it might sound, many are less than a page of code.)\n\nIn terms of practical stuff... at least when I was at Cal, there wasn't a good course on how to apply ML in practice.  I haven't taken this class but it looks like it's probably more than you need.\n\nhttps://www.coursera.org/learn/competitive-data-science", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1588411120, "gildings": {}, "id": "fp91vwk", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gbpw4i", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_fp904xv", "permalink": "/r/berkeley/comments/gbpw4i/how_useful_is_data_100/fp91vwk/", "retrieved_on": 1588411121, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "berkeley", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh9w", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1588411120.0}]
