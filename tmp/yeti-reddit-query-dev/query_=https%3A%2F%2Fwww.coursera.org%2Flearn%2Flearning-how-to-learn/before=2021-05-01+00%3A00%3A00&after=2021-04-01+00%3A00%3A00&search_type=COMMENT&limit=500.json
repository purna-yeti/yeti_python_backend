That is very different from applying ML.\n\nIf you want to make good forecasts on data - for fun or as a job - then I have some ideas. In my view most advice you can find on the internet does not really enable you to make good forecasts, but costs a lot of time. It may be interesting, but too theoretical.\n\nYour first goal could be to get hands-on experience on a Kaggle competition. The monthly tabular competitions are a good start. Don't bother about the final 1% on accuracy, as these models tend to be an unstable mess, but you should be able to beat public baseline notebooks from scratch. Remember, that not all what is done in Kaggle notebooks actually makes sense. Most the of code is redundant, but no-one cares to remove it as it takes careful  experimentation.\n\nWhen someday most of [https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html) is clear to you on a high level, then you are in a good spot. Additionally, some basic understanding of a neural network is needed.\n\nA classic beginners introduction to machine learning is [https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)\n\nThen you need some basic understanding of Gradient Boosted Trees and Neural Networks. But after a basic understanding it's more fruitful to invest time in learning how to use the library (sklearn, pytorch, lightgbm, catboost) and train/tune the model in practice.\n\nMost books are essential for ML researchers, but they don't really make you a better forecaster (and I have a lot of those recommended books).\n\nTime series forecasting and causal learning is often left out from courses, but you rarely get to apply it successfully.\n\nThere is a lot of information around, but most has a low forecasting success to time invested ratio.

Wolfram talks about the [Principle of Computational Equivalence](https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/p715--basic-framework/) and I like to think of this when I was choosing to learn Python over the variety of other languages out there. In a nutshell the idea is a programming language which reaches a certain level of complexity is essentially equivalent to all other languages in so far as they can all accomplish the same tasks. Then, the devil is in the details: _How easy is it to write? How developed is the ecosystem of supporting packages? How big is the user community? How supportive is the user community? What is the learning curve? How suited is the language for the task you wish to accomplish?_ Which is to say, as others here have noted, it depends...\n\nThird, if you're not compelled by school, work, or your friends to choose one language over another, then by all means you should try several.

In the course he explains basic computing principles while comparing three languages: SML, Racket, and RUBY. If this class does nothing else, it will open your eyes to the Principle of Computational Equivalence I mentioned above.\n\nFinally, community is essential.

I took a couple free courses on Coursera through Penn State and found that it was something I really enjoyed. I continued taking GIS courses through Penn State until I got my Post-bacchalaureate certficate (which was either 4 or 5 courses), which I used to get an internship at a local government for the summer and then my first job. I'm not seeing the same courses I took, but UC Davis has a [GIS specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/gis) on there. Coursera was free when I took it and it charges now, but still less than any college would charge. You can try out a course on there and see if its something you'd really be interested in. \n\nIn addition, what I also did was find some companies very close to me that had GIS jobs available, and I sent their HR departments emails saying that I was interested in going in to GIS as an educational option, and wanted to see how it's used, and could I job shadow a GIS professional for a day just to see how it was used in a professional setting. They agreed and I just sat down and watched a guy work on a work on producing permit prints for a telecommunications project for a day while peppering him with questions. It was a pretty worthwhile experience - and I work in the telecom industry today.\n\nAlso, at least from what I've seen, knowledge and experience trumps education. A lot of people I work with either have associates degrees or a bachelor's degree in something else with a GIS minor. I haven't met anyone with a master's, and it doesn't sound like that on its own would open a lot of doors. Get your first job, learn as much as you can, and learn how to use Model Builder and how to code a little bit in Python. Having a little bit of coding experience or anything that helps you contribute to automation will make you more marketable. You can summarize GIS data and export into formats like Exel documents,  and learning some of the slightly-more-complicated Microsoft Excel formulas will give you a leg up. A lot of management types are seemingly only management types because they know how Pivot Tables work. No exaggeration.\n\nAnother one in your first job is to keep an open line of communication with other departments that use your data - for me, that include field technicians, civil engineers, managers, and accountants.

The book isn't perfect, but it's super insightful because it's written by professors. The concepts in this book helped form the basis of my exam writing advice, but it's worth diving deep into it. There is also something called LEEWS that I've heard good things about, but never tried.\n\n\nLearning the actual structure of law school and strategies for success is way more important than learning content. But if you've gone through all the stuff above and still have time, you can get into some basic content for free too. [This free intro to Law course from Yale](https://www.coursera.org/learn/law-student) isn't bad for getting familiar with some basic concepts. There's also a lecture series on Civil Procedure by Richard Freer that lots of people swear by, and you can find it illegally for free if you search hard enough. You can also read a few famous cases, not to actually learn but to get familiar with how they're structured and written. Beyond that, if you still have time, I guess you could start browsing common 1L supplements. The most recommended ones are Chirelstein for Contracts, Spencer for Civ Pro, Chemerinsky for Con Law, Dressler for Crim, and the Examples &amp; Explanations series for everything else.\n\n\nYou should also devote time to sorting out your personal life before 1L starts. Doctors, weddings, taxes... any possible distraction should be eliminated (that you can predict - obviously unexpected things will pop up later).", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1617716989, "gildings": {}, "id": "gtki1ot", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_mlbcq2", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_mlbcq2", "permalink": "/r/LawSchool/comments/mlbcq2/what_prep_course_should_i_take_before_1l/gtki1ot/", "retrieved_on": 1617717011, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LawSchool", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rb9g", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1617716989.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "Bacon_Nipples", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_gni3i", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Hey, I strongly recommend taking this course:\n\nhttps://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn\n\nI know you probably don't want to add more stuff to \"study\" but this course teaches amazing techniques to better study and learn things without having to grind 13 hours a day.

Let me tell you friend that shit is true for Ph.D. even if it is not their area of study.  The problem is when you are producing research you have to be very technical and VERY specific in you language.  In math for example if you will see odd symbols all the time and logic phrases like \"if and only if\" all the time and it can be confusing.  However, you should not expect to understand them even with a bachelors degree completed in the field.  Sometimes you can like humanities because they feel more intuitive, since it is they are studies of humans, and they have more flexible language.  If researchers do not use rigid language then it introduces ambiguity which is very dangerous in sciences.  That said what you are talking about is a very serious concern for many academics and is discussed often.  \n\nI am pursuing a masters in information science which is the study of how people consume, organize and distribute information.  Currently journal articles are only truly accessible to academics in their field because the language used is a barrier.  As you have noticed this means you have to get a Ph.D. in a subject just to read the thing not because it is to complex but because the sheer amount of unnatural vocabulary.  There are projects being done create machine learning programs that can translate documents into a language that is more regular so that it is accessible to everyone, but who knows how long that will take. \n\nI worked as a mathematics tutor for 5 years and no matter how much a student thought they couldn't learn a lesson I have always been able to translate the lesson in a way they eventually get.  The problem isn't that they couldn't do math it was often they couldn't understand the question, or they didn't know what steps to take.  The thing is your teacher explains a subject 1 time often 1 way in \\~1 hour.  Math is not intuitive so if you do not know how to do something it can feel like banging your head into a wall hoping for an epiphany.  What I did was try to explain how to do something, if it didn't work I said it differently, if that didn't work maybe I tried writing it in a step order, if that didn't work maybe I color code the steps.... you just keep trying alternatives until something resonates.  After they got one though now they can actually practice.  The reason I mention this is because it sounds like you were either jumping way to deeply into the subject too fast, or no one offered you an alternative.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; Another thing would be teaching people statistics because after taking some stats courses I was able to see how easy it is to manipulate statistics to come to the conclusions you want. \n\nAfter critical thinking this needs to be a mandatory subject for every single citizen.  My original area of study as an undergraduate was statistics but I had to change to a uni that did not have it due to funding.  When I took stats the first time I did really well.  When I worked under a professor at my other university who taught the only stats course we had I was blown away.  The 1st week of every semester was stats ethics.  He would show how charts are manipulated to look better, how ignoring data can give you the results you want, and how many will pretend that correlation=causation which is a big no.  This is manipulation of the masses via gate keeping through university.  My public school did not have a stats course so there is no way I would know how to spot bad statistics without my courses.  While we need to combat academic jargon I understand it has some purpose, I cannot validate statistics not being standardized in any way.  \n\nIf you do consider going back to college or find an opportunity through your job paying for it or something, I hope you may.  That said you are not any less intelligent because of it and you can gain the same usefulness from MOOCs online.(free online courses)  I will list a few below and if you would like me to find specific ones I have a pretty solid collection of them so I am sure I can.

Enjoy learning how to learn.\n***\n[^(About Me)](https://redd.it/kfv164) ^(|) [^(Feedback)](https://www.reddit.com/user/IWantToLearnBot/comments/kfv4ag/feedback_suggestions_resource_recommendations/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1617270888, "gildings": {}, "id": "gt0itki", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_mhrxe1", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_mhrxe1", "permalink": "/r/IWantToLearn/comments/mhrxe1/iwtl_how_to_learn_latin/gt0itki/", "retrieved_on": 1617270899, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1617270888.0}]
