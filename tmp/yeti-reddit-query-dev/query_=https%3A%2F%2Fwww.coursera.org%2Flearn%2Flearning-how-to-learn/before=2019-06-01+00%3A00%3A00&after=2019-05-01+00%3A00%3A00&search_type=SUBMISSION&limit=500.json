We\u2019ll learn about the how the brain uses two very different learning modes and how it encapsulates (\u201cchunks\u201d) information. We\u2019ll also cover illusions of learning, memory techniques, dealing with procrastination, and best practices shown by research to be most effective in helping you master tough subjects. \n\n [https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did this course about 2 years ago, after listening to Barbara Oakley's audiobook, **A Mind For Numbers: How to Excel at Math and Science**.\n\nMathphobia is a real thing for me, but I recognize how not being good at math has held me back in my life. So, I listened to that book. Then, while looking for a math course, I came across this course. Recognizing the instructor's name, I thought, \"Interesting. Why not?\"\n\nThe course can be successfully completed by anyone, and it can be done for free. \n\nI found it helpful in learning just about anything, not just math. It's helped me coach my kids through learning some things too. Of course, they aren't going to listen to everything I say, but what they did pick up definitely helped them.\n\nThis course should be mandatory at the secondary school level in my opinion, maybe even earlier. \n\nI highly recommend you take this course prior to returning to college, even if you are a good student. It can only make you better.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "CollegeAfter40", "subreddit_id": "t5_125qs2", "subreddit_subscribers": 2, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "COURSE REVIEW: Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1559657027, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeAfter40/comments/buug5q/course_review_learning_how_to_learn_powerful/", "created": 1559229676.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "Ddppat92", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1n3vyn7n", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1558818899, "domain": "self.datascience", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/bszpo8/my_learning_process_need_advice/", "gildings": {}, "id": "bszpo8", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "education", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "99f9652a-d780-11e7-b558-0e52cdd59ace", "link_flair_text": "Education", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/bszpo8/my_learning_process_need_advice/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1558818900, "score": 1, "selftext": "So before I start, I work in digital marketing, no college, know HTML and CSS, and want to change careers. I have been eyeballing data science for a year or so because I love math, solving shit and want to get more into coding and machine learning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want honest advice on my learning process. i have somewhat of a loose plan in place. I am in no rush, my goal is summer 2020, but I am spending time almost everyday on progressing myself towards my goal. This isn't the first time I changed careers so I know how to hustle and get shit done, but I know this will be a whole other animal. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the plan: \n\n1. Learn Python (already started - early) \n   1. Right now I am just watching YouTube videos, is there a recommended course I should take? I am willing to pay for a credible course, especially if it is geared towards data science/machine learning.\n      1.  [https://www.udemy.com/automate/](https://www.udemy.com/automate/) \n      2. &amp;#x200B;\n   2. Do I need to learn Python with a certain thing in mind as I get more advanced? The goal was to also use it for other things, so I was just going to become proficient in it. \n2. Learn the different types of math. \n   1. Pretty much just read books and learn it like I did in school. \n3. Applying knowledge to tangible projects for a resume. \n   1. I am not getting too ahead of myself yet, just taking the first basic baby steps at the moment. I havent even started to think about this part yet. Should I? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do not want to go back to college, I work full time and just don't know if I want to do that. I am pretty self sufficient so I don't need a school to get me to do this stuff. I have debated going to a bootcamp, but again I feel pretty confident I can go without it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am wondering though, if there are data science courses online that anyone has taken? Ill list out a few that I have been looking at, but want to make sure its worth it for these specific courses. They get pricey.. \n\n1.

I have also heard data quest is good. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny help from those who have gone through what I am successfully or are in the field would be much appreciated. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "datascience", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "subreddit_subscribers": 121259, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My learning process - Need advice", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1559623332, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/bszpo8/my_learning_process_need_advice/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1558818899.0}]
