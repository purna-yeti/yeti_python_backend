Unfortunately that book seems to be quite hyperbolic, and is causing more confusion than necessary. What book is it?\n\nIt's worth outlining two ML training paradigms - **supervised learning** and **unsupervised learning**. It seems this book is throwing around these terms without properly explaining how they are used.\n\nSupervised learning is what you mentioned - your model is training using a large amount of **labelled** training data. That is, your data consists of features and labels. The features are input into the model, and it tries to predict the label. It then checks if the prediction was correct by comparing it to the label, and attempts to update its parameters according to how wrong/right the prediction was. This is the default setting that you will see most neural nets using.\n\nUnsupervised learning is a little different. In unsupervised learning the data **is not labelled** \\- we just have the features, and no knowledge of what is the \"correct answer\". A classic example of this is a clustering algorithm, where the model attempts to group similar data-points into clusters.  Whilst neural nets are primarily used in a supervised setting, **you can do unsupervised learning with a neural net**.\n\nNeural nets learn through a loss function - this captures how correct the prediction was. A standard approach is to use mean-squared error, which is the average squared difference between your predictions and your labels. This is a classic supervised learning approach. In order to do unsupervised learning, you still need something to compare your predictions to. One way of doing this is to compare the outputs between  a data-point, and a slightly modified version of itself. If we are working with images, this could be a rotated version of the input image. The goal is then to learn the same output for the original data-point, and the rotated data-point. The hope is that by doing this you are learning something fundamental to the nature of your images, which can then be used for later tasks. Another example is with text. You can input a sentence into a neural net, with one of the words removed. The net then has to learn to predict what the word was. This is still unsupervised (you may see it referred to as self-supervised as well), as there is no additional label provided to the model.\n\nThe standard learning paradigm for neural nets is supervised learning, so for now, I would spend your time learning about supervised neural nets before concerning yourself too much with unsupervised learning in this context. Regarding your specific questions, I hope that has somewhat answered them, but I will give a specific answer for each:\n\n&gt;ANNs learn on the go (if provided the correct answer in advance)\n\nNeural nets typically learn through being fed a large dataset at once, that is then split up into smaller **batches.** Each batch is fed through the system and used to update its parameters. There is a paradigm called online learning, where a model learns on the go, and neural nets can be used in the context. Typically, you would need to have pre-trained your net on a large dataset. Once you have a working model, you can then collect data on the fly, for example, through users filling in forms, or clicking on adverts or something. Once you've collected enough data you can then train the neural net a little more with your new data. This process can be repeated-  collect more data, train the net a little more, collect more data, train it some more. This would typically requires labels for each of the data-points.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;General  ML Algorithms are fed a large amount of data at the same time and  patterns are automatically extracted from the data and used as a model  to predict future inputs?\n\nYes, this is correct, but it also applies to neural nets. Most of these algorithms are all supervised, so require large amounts of **labelled** data.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;ANNs can ONLY be trained when given the correct answer in advance\n\nTypically, yes, they are a supervised learning model. Although as explained, there are contexts where the correct answers is not always explicitly given to the model (unsupervised learning).\n\nI hope that has cleared things up a little. Feel free to ask any questions. If you want to keep learning about ML, I would strongly recommend [this course by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1593251849, "gildings": {}, "id": "fw5jgcy", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_hdeilg", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_fw3clgz", "permalink": "/r/MachineLearning/comments/hdeilg/d_simple_questions_thread_june_21_2020/fw5jgcy/", "retrieved_on": 1593251850, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "MachineLearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r3gv", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1593251849.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "BornGarlic", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_quyvap", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Mental health may be a better focus in the short (and long) term then.

So that is relaxation.\n\n**When you're stressed: narrowed perception, systematic thinking, and enhanced memory**\n\nWhat about stress? You have the exact opposite: your working memory focuses on one thing. You forget everything else and you focus on this problem. Your brain is using all of its resources to deal with this situation. You become much more systematic in your processing and in your rational brain. Therefore, whatever you do notice becomes central to what is happening. Noticing the texture of the dashboard, the shine of the droplets that are racing through the windshield, the honk of the car approaching yours. All of those details pop up and are stored in memory. Again, you can explain this evolutionarily (or functionally), by thinking that you probably want to be quite aware of everything that happened when the lion attacked you and your tribe; you really don't want that to happen again, because it's a high price to pay. \n\n*All of these processes* (narrowed perception, systematic thinking, and enhanced memory) are what have you notice and remember things that weren't there before. Your brain has revved up to deal with a single problem, and you're systematically using all of your processing power to understand it.\n\n**When you're stressed: your body prepares**\n\nAdditionally, with adrenaline (and other hormones that are usually secreted alongside it), your body prepares to fight-or-flight. Your physiology changes by pumping blood to vital organs, by having you piss or shit yourself to carry less weight and run faster, having your pupils dilate to perceive better. All of this can give you the impression that things are happening faster, since you're suddenly able to do things that you wouldn't have been able to do before.\n\n**So** ***are you*** **processing things faster when you're stressed?**\n\nTogether, the psychological effects (narrow attention, systematic processing, and enhanced memory) and the physical effects (to prepare you to act quickly), make it seem as if you're reacting faster. So, I'd say it'd be most appropriate to say you're narrowing down your focus and your body is both making you perceive more acutely and preparing you to fight or run.\n\n\\* I posted my reply as a root comment as well, because I liked what I wrote and I didn't want it lost in the comments. How vain of me, huh?\n\n\\*\\* Chunks can be small or large. It depends on how well ingrained you've got the information in your memory. For example, learning for the first time the digits of a phone number can mean you think about each digit individually (e.g. \"9\", \"1\", \"1\"); after a while you've got those three number chunked into a single easy-to-remember \"911\". This is called \"chunking\". Chunking accounts for the differences in measurements of working memory. Some researchers used to think we had up to a dozen 'slots' in our working memory. New research, however, shows that the number is probably 3-7.\n\n**TL;DR: Your perception is narrowed to the problem you've got to deal with right now (and nothing else) and your body is ready to fight or run.

You become much more systematic in your processing and in your rational brain. Therefore, whatever you do notice becomes central to what is happening. Noticing the texture of the dashboard, the shine of the droplets that are racing through the windshield, the honk of the car approaching yours. All of those details pop up and are stored in memory. Again, you can explain this evolutionarily (or functionally), by thinking that you probably want to be quite aware of everything that happened when the lion attacked you and your tribe; you really don't want that to happen again, because it's a high price to pay. \n\n*All of these processes* (narrowed perception, systematic thinking, and enhanced memory) are what have you notice and remember things that weren't there before. Your brain has revved up to deal with a single problem, and you're systematically using all of your processing power to understand it.\n\n**When you're stressed: your body prepares**\n\nAdditionally, with adrenaline (and other hormones that are usually secreted alongside it), your body prepares to fight-or-flight. Your physiology changes by pumping blood to vital organs, by having you piss or shit yourself to carry less weight and run faster, having your pupils dilate to perceive better. All of this can give you the impression that things are happening faster, since you're suddenly able to do things that you wouldn't have been able to do before.\n\n**So** ***are you*** **processing things faster when you're stressed?**\n\nTogether, the psychological effects (narrow attention, systematic processing, and enhanced memory) and the physical effects (to prepare you to act quickly), make it seem as if you're reacting faster. So, I'd say it'd be most appropriate to say you're narrowing down your focus and your body is both making you perceive more acutely and preparing you to fight or run.\n\n\\* I post it here as well because I liked what I wrote and I didn't want it lost in the comments. How vain of me, huh?\n\n\\*\\* Chunks can be small or large. It depends on how well ingrained you've got the information in your memory. For example, learning for the first time the digits of a phone number can mean you think about each digit individually (e.g. \"9\", \"1\", \"1\"); after a while you've got those three number chunked into a single easy-to-remember \"911\".

[heres one fantastic online course(s)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms) note: it's taught in pseudocode, and more math heavy than other similar courses offered by different schools, but an extremely highly praised course nonetheless (its technically one course, but is broken up into 4 online).

I'm a huge sports fan, especially the NFL, and would often wager on games, and play fantasysports (if you're not familiar no worries, its a way to wager on far more complex outcomes than just who wins...but how players perform and being rewarded for stats specific players get...will save a rant here about it). but basically, I thought it would be a great idea to build something relevant to datascience, but also reflect my own interests. so my project was related to NFL predictive analytics. when you work on a large project, youll have to become familiar with many different things, that will all carry relevance to an actual role. like one: just getting the data...scraping it, storing it in a database, analyzing it...etc.   \nI only mentioned my example, as a possible way to motivate your own ideas. there is no 'right' project. rather work on something youll find interesting, and something youll be able to passionately talk about in interviews.   \nother times, if you look at applications for various positions, companies might literally list specific things they are looking for.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1592420444, "edited": 1592420813.0, "gildings": {}, "id": "fv5gnwm", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_hawz7x", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_fv5dclw", "permalink": "/r/learnpython/comments/hawz7x/finished_mitx_classes_hungry_to_learn_more_at/fv5gnwm/", "retrieved_on": 1592422767, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "learnpython", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r8ot", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1592420444.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "pianobutter", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5qdxz", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Along with Harvard's course that's already been mentioned here, I would recommend [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) as a bonus.

The problem is, it's all vague memories now re. when I actually got that info. \n\n1. I *definitely remember* that there is a prominent book about the subject, The Storytelling Animal, which I've never read though. I think it must have some references to research studies. It definitely had some explanations connected to how our brain works. // I've just checked \u2014 it seems there are some short animated videos on Youtube with summaries of that book / its ideas. And the author's TED talk. \n2. In my old browser bookmarks I've found only these two relevant things: [The Science of Storytelling (Infographic)](https://merkleyandpartners.wordpress.com/2015/06/04/the-science-of-storytelling-infographic/) and [Telling science stories...wait, what's a \"story\"?](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/a-blog-around-the-clock/httpblogsscientificamericancoma-blog-around-the-clock20110713telling-science-stories-wait-whats-a-story/)\n3. There was a huge hype a few(?) years ago about adding the storytelling element or meta-structure even to business presentations because it made them more powerful. Like, there were seminars teaching people do that.\n\nSo maybe a more accurate term for me to use wasn't \"learn better\", but \"get affected stronger\"\u2026\n\nAlso, my guess is that, for example, if your brain isn't neurotypical in the ways other than ADHD (e.g. if you are on autism spectrum), then you might react to storytelling in general differently\u2026 \n\n---\n\nAs for best practices for **studying,** a free course on Coursera, [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) (it's based on the book with a very imperfect title, A Mind for Numbers) is what I keep seeing recommended.\n\nI took that course a while ago. It has human stories, beware ;) As for some kind of summary of the materials of that course\u2026\n\n* [this 2-page PDF](http://www.math.toronto.edu/nhoell/10rules-of-studying.pdf)  (10 rules of good studying; 10 rules of bad studying) and a somewhat different version for kids &amp; teens ([this 2-page PDF](https://barbaraoakley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-Top-Ideas-to-Help-Your-Learning-and-10-Pitfalls-1.pdf)). Pretty cool advice, science-based (in the course materials, the lecturers provide the links to the supporting research studies).\n* the diffuse vs fixed mode of thinking is explained in simple terms on pages 4-6 in [this free PDF excerpt](https://barbaraoakley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Learning-How-to-Learn-Excerpt.pdf).\n\nAnd such books as Ultralearning by Scott Young; \"Be so good they can't ignore you\" and \"Deep Work\" by Cal Newport; a book about learning by Josh Waitzkin ([here is Tim Ferriss' interview with him,](https://tim.blog/2019/07/03/the-tim-ferriss-show-transcripts-josh-waitzkin-how-to-cram-2-months-of-learning-into-1-day-375/) *with a transcript)* pop up on my radar from time to time. I tried watching that interview a while ago and the thing that stuck with me is how he said that something I already knew by then \u2014 different things work for different people, some seemingly absurd ways of learning can be extremely powerful for some people &amp; some very \"proper\" ways can give worse results.\n\nAs for other chunks of advice, I've seen this stuff:\n\n* ADHD-specific advice:\n   * Use two versions of the book (audio and text) at the same time ([explanations](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/goto56/adhd_reading_tip/))\n   * [Someone's studying approach](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/gz8y6x/how_i_studied_smarter_not_harder/) that was shared in /r/ADHD sub recently.\n* Make mindmaps for the books you are reading ([someone's complex, dense example for Ultralearning book](https://i.redd.it/xdmmtb0ab8r31.jpg)) - it also nudges you into actually finishing the book\n* [This textbook reading advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/gvhj65/how_do_you_know_what_to_take_notes_on_in_your/fsq9ure/) (a gilded comment!) by someone who used to tutor college students.\n* From a sports psychology book: as soon after making a mistake as possible, you need to visualize your *correct performance* in that situation. But visualization skill is a muscle, so it will take time to train yourself to do high-quality visualizations. \n* Tim Ferriss' CaFE technique. It's for accelerated learning. \n   * Can I encapsulate the most important 20 percent into an easily graspable one-pager?\n   * How frequently should I practice? Can I cram and what should my schedule look like? What growing pains can I predict? What is the minimum effective dose (otherwise known as the MED) for volume?\n   * The E stands for encoding.

So let's plug that into our equation:\n\nA1\\*300 = 0.5\n\nYou can transform that equation to get A1:\n\nA1 = 0.5/300 = (roughly) 0.00167\n\nAnd you are done.\n\nYou now have a perceptron, defined as:\n\n0.00167 X = Y.\n\nLet's say you have a 50k $ house. 50 \\* 0.00167 = 0.0835. That's less than 0.5 so we return 0 (cheap).\n\nOf course, in practice you generally have more than one argument. You will have multiple X-es (and for each a corresponding weight). But the logic is the same - combine X inputs into a single Y by multiplying each by corresponding A. Then apply some kind of function that turns your Y into 0 or 1.\n\nThe difficulty is of course in finding weights. In the example above I could solve it directly since it was literally a single variable and just one example. But in practice it might not be so easy - that's what we refer to as training. Essentially, you go over each example of your Xs and known Ys and update weights accordingly so it gets closer to the correct result.\n\nSo for instance I could give you a list of 100 houses, their prices and whether they are considered \"cheap\" or \"expensive\" and you would try to find such a weight A for which most of the examples fit in the correct category. So for instance start from A1 = 1, see it gives correct result for like 2 houses out of 100, then try 0.9 and so on and on until you find an optimum value. Well, there are whole algorithms for just that but I would rather not get into explaining gradient descent and whatnot in a reddit post at 1 am :P\n\nThere's also what we refer to as an error/loss function. You can tell how well your Perceptron is doing by taking all examples in the dataset and seeing how well it did. Cost of a wrong prediction in this is 1 (if you mislabel true as false or vice versa). So to calculate your overall error rate it's pretty much number_of_failed_examples / number_of_all_examples (I am simplifying). This will return a value between 0 (no errors at all) to 1 (everything is wrong). And you want to get as close to said 0 as possible. Long story short - this function is important since it tells your training algorithm on whether or not it's going in the right direction (if error is increasing, you are doing something wrong and if it's decreasing, that means you are getting closer to optimal values of A).", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1591831789, "edited": 1591832896.0, "gildings": {}, "id": "ftn0js4", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_h0mk21", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_h0mk21", "permalink": "/r/learnprogramming/comments/h0mk21/perceptrons/ftn0js4/", "retrieved_on": 1591845856, "score": 2, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "learnprogramming", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r7yd", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1591831789.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "hitherto_insignia", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1amm1df9", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "There's a free course on coursera.

YMMV.  I'm in IT so the learning / certification cycle is constant.  This is what I do to maximize the use of my training time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst - free course, 12 hours, fix your learning habits: [https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) \\- There's also a book by the same author with the same title that the Coursera course is based on.  I read the book and then did the Coursera course.\n\nSecond - [https://apps.ankiweb.net/](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) make flash cards.  This is hard to do correctly.  Read this: [https://collegeinfogeek.com/flash-card-study-tips/](https://collegeinfogeek.com/flash-card-study-tips/)\n\nThird - Review your flashcards EVERY DAY.  The default settings that Anki uses are sane; don't mess with them unless you REALLY know what you're doing.\n\nFourth - \"I'll make flash cards after I'm done reading this book\" is the wrong thing to do.  As you are reading the book you make flash cards as soon as possible.  If you get an idea for a flashcard mid-sentence while reading, then you go make that card and then restart reading that sentence / paragraph as needed.  Oh - you got a practice exam question wrong?  Can you turn that into a \"why?\" or \"explain...\" type of flashcard?\n\nFifth - Flashcards with words like \"Explain why\" are really good.  DO NOT make multiple-choice flashcards.  One of my epic failures was due to making multiple-choice formatted flashcards... scored 35% on an exam... oooof.  Ah, the illusion of competence...\n\nSixth - Have a friend that isn't taking the CSC exam but is interested in the material?  Start teaching the material to them.  If they can interact and ask questions about the material, all the better.  The trick is you have to be willing to say \"I don't know\" and \"I'm not sure\" and then go look up and review a topic until you have mastered it.  Some people have a really hard time admitting they don't know something when they are teaching; be warned.\n\nSeventh - Don't skip labs.  If there's any hands-on examples or labs you can do in the course then do them.  Repeatedly.  I'm not familiar with the CSC course, but I can guess you need to be able to suggest what securities particular person should buy based on some criteria.  Find someone to act as an imaginary client looking for recommendations with a made-up backstory.  Run through the exercise with them.  See if you can get a mentor / someone who is already passed the course to grade your results.  I don't know if this would work for the CSC, but I hope you get the general idea.
