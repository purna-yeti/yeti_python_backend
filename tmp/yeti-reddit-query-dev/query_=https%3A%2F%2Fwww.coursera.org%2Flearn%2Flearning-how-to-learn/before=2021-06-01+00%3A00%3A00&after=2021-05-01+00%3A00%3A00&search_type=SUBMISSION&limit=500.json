2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/moneyview/comments/m0zzr1/money_and_banking_summer_2021/) master post.\n\nToday (May 19th) we're watching [Economics of Money and Banking](https://www.coursera.org/learn/money-banking) Lecture 1: [The Four Prices of Money](http://sites.bu.edu/perry/mb-lectures/section-1/1-the-four-prices-of-money/).\n\nFor a concise overview/refresher of Perry Mehrling's Money View, check out Elham Saeidinezhad's Money View Primer: [*Promises All the Way Down*](https://lpeproject.org/blog/promises-all-the-way-down-a-primer-on-the-money-view/).\n\nThe lectures for this course were filmed in the fall of 2012, but the world didn't stop then.  For more Money View resources, including more recent/ongoing material, see:\n\n* [Archive](http://sites.bu.edu/perry/files/2019/01/Money-View-Archive.pdf) of the original *The Money View* blog, which goes from November 2010 to October 2012.\n* Perry Mehrling's more [recent blog](http://sites.bu.edu/perry/blog/current/), which has posts from April 2015 to June 2020.\n* Dan Neilson's [*Soon Parted*](https://neilson.substack.com/) Substack, which just started a few months ago and he updates regularly.\n* Zoltan Poszar's [*Global Money Notes*](https://dokumen.pub/qdownload/zoltan-pozsar-global-money-notes-1-31-2015-2020.html), which runs from May 2015 to June 2020.\n\n## Part 1: The Big Picture\n\n[Part 1: The Big Picture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNEouYM5wRE&amp;list=PLSuwqsAnJMtwZEwkJgHZCod2xP9b7skF5&amp;index=1)\n\nThe landscape of money and banking is always changing.  But there are parts that stay the same.  Mehrling asks what are the universal truths or \"eternal verities\" of money and banking.  What does financial globalization tell us about those universal truths?  How do those universal truths apply to a world of financial globalization?\n\nMehrling's goal of explaining financial globalization is somewhat inchoate at the time of these lectures.  The second part of the course will focus more on international money and banking, but Mehrling would have a lot more to say about that today.  His next book is going to tell the story of the rise of the international dollar system through the intellectual lens of Charles Kindleberger.  So we all have that to look forward to.\n\n## Part 2: Prerequisites?\n\n[Part 2: Prerequisites?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZPvJa9_hWI&amp;list=PLSuwqsAnJMtwZEwkJgHZCod2xP9b7skF5&amp;index=2)\n\nFor the most part, this course doesn't use a conventional economics framework.\n\n## Part 3: What is a Bank, a Shadow Bank, A Central Bank?\n\n[Part 3: What is a Bank, a Shadow Bank, A Central Bank?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz7kk7s-v4k&amp;list=PLSuwqsAnJMtwZEwkJgHZCod2xP9b7skF5&amp;index=3)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img wxzmtxlok2071...*\n\nSomething that's often missing from a balance sheet is the timing of the cashflows.  Assets represent promised future cash inflows, and liabilities represent commitments for future cash outflows.  *Solvency* tells us whether the total volume of cash inflows is sufficient to meet the total volume of cash commitments.  *Liquidity* tells us whether *today's* cash inflows can cover *today's* cash commitments.  We can think of liquidity as solvency for the subset of the balance sheet that's \"happening now.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vf0n3grtk2071.png?width=543&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02494d1683d47c3c80ba6a08186ddd108bc86301\n\nA shadow bank is like a bank, but its assets and liabilities are both market-based instruments.  It borrows from the market and lends to the market: money-market funding of capital-market lending.\n\n## Part 4: Central Themes?\n\n[Part 4: Central Themes?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPEnV3ZC708&amp;list=PLSuwqsAnJMtwZEwkJgHZCod2xP9b7skF5&amp;index=4)\n\nThinking of banking as a payment system highlights the importance of liquidity.  And understanding banks (and dealers) as profit-seeking market-makers allows us to understand where the liquidity comes from.\n\nThere's a nice 2015 blog post by Perry Mehrling, [*Why is money difficult?*](http://sites.bu.edu/perry/2015/06/08/why-is-money-difficult/), that describes some of the motivation for explaining money.\n\n&gt;In my teaching, I have come to appreciate a variety of barriers that people bring with them to the study of money, and to appreciate the necessity of bringing these barriers up to consciousness as part of the process of learning. \u2014Perry Mehrling, *Why is money difficult?*\n\nThe \"alchemy of banking\" can be summarized as:\n\n&gt;All banking is a swap of IOUs.\n\nHere is the quintessential banking operation as an expansion of both sides of the balance sheet:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bjpey49xk2071.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=939f5e5b0e27f197e4cb93ea604bfe3e2e3cf970\n\nBoth parties now owe each other something.  The bank is now on the hook for the deposits and the borrower is on the hook for the loan.\n\nThe four prices of money:\n\n* **Par** \u2014 the price of one money in terms of another money *right now*\n* **Interest Rate** \u2014 the price of money today in terms of money tomorrow\n* **Exchange Rate** \u2014 the price of domestic money in terms of foreign money (e.g. gold)\n* **Price Level** \u2014 the price of money in terms of commodities/goods\n\n## Par\n\n\"One money in terms of another money,\" does *not* mean that two different currencies are pegged to each other one-to-one.  Instead, there are multiple monetary instruments denominated in the *same unit* that must be convertible into each other.  Your bank deposits have to be convertible into physical cash, and you'd expect to get one dollar of cash for every dollar of deposits.  That's par.\n\nStablecoins are an interesting case study in maintaining par.  See Dan Neilson's [recent Substack](https://neilson.substack.com/p/tether-on-par) about the Tether stablecoin.\n\n&gt;Reserves and deposits are two different assets, between which there could be basis risk. But the banking regulatory system is set up to insure the basis risk, so that they function as good substitutes *within that regulatory context*. That is a context which does not, currently, apply to Tether. \u2014Dan Neilson, *Tether*\n\n## Interest Rate\n\nSince all banking is a swap of IOUs, it can seem like nothing's happening.  But it useful to look at who's paying interest to who.  If you're paying interest on your loan, then you're paying the bank for a service.  Their IOU to you (deposits) is worth more than your IOU to them (the loan).  Interest is what you pay them to get them to do the swap.\n\n## Exchange Rate\n\nFor the first part of the course, we will be imagining a gold standard world.  Under an international gold standard, since everyone is pegged to gold, foreign money is the same thing as gold.  The important feature of an international gold standard isn't the \"gold\" part so much as it is the \"international standard\" part.\n\nExchange rates get more complicated when we move onto floating exchange-rate currencies.\n\n## Price Level\n\nThis is the least emphasized price of money in this course, but it's still important.  Money is, after all, meaningless unless it has some non-money things to buy.  In a gold-standard world, focusing on the gold peg is often a sufficient substitute for focusing on the price of commodities in general.\n\n## Part 5: Readings: Allyn Young\n\n[Part 5: Readings: Allyn Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VstsTPHaB4&amp;list=PLSuwqsAnJMtwZEwkJgHZCod2xP9b7skF5&amp;index=5)\n\nThe four chapters we'll read for week 2 represent only a tiny fraction of the 36 total encyclopedia articles Young wrote for the 1924/1929 edition of *The Book of Popular Science*.  I haven't read any Young beyond the four assigned chapters, but you can read the rest\u2014and more\u2014in [*Money and Growth: Selected papers of Allyn Abbott Young*](https://www.amazon.com/Money-Growth-Selected-Routledge-Economics-dp-0415757622/dp/0415757622/) Edited by Perry Mehrling and Roger Sandilands.\n\nThe reading will have its own discussion thread, which I will post on Sunday, May 23rd.\n\nEnjoy Lecture 1.  Please post any questions and comments below.

I start the program myself next month.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSkillBridge- what is it?\n\n Any rank, enlisted or officer, may apply for SkillBridge. SkillBridge permits you to use up to the last 180 days of Service to train and learn with an industry partner. During SkillBridge participation you continue to receive military compensation and you are covered by your military benefits. Release for SkillBridge is always mission-dependent and your unit Commander must authorize participation prior to entering into any agreement with interested industry employment partners. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoogle IT is one of the approved programs for SkillBridge with an already approved MOU with the military to do online, self-paced courses typically on Coursera. There are currently 13 different courses to pick from. The one I am approved for is  Google Cloud Certified, Associate Cloud Engineer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are all the program options from the SkillBridge site, and what I BELIEVE to be the course link:\n\n[Google Career Certificate - Data Analytics](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) beginner level, recommended 10hrs/wk for 6 months\n\n[Google Career Certificate - Project Management](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-project-management) beginner level, recommended 10hrs/wk for 6 months\n\n[Google Career Certificate - User Experience Design](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-ux-design) beginner level, recommended 10hrs/wk for 6 months\n\n[Google Cloud Certified, Associate Cloud Engineer](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/cloud-engineering-gcp) intermediate level, recommended 4hrs/wk for 4 months\n\n[Google Cloud Certified, Professional Cloud Architect](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/gcp-cloud-architect) intermediate level, recommended 6hrs/wk for 3 months\n\n Google Cloud Certified, Professional Cloud Developer \n\n[Google Cloud Certified, Professional Cloud DevOps Engineer](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/sre-devops-engineer-google-cloud)  beginner level, recommended 5hrs/wk for 3 months\n\n[Google Cloud Certified, Professional Cloud Network Engineer](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-cloud-networking) intermediate level, recommended 7hrs/wk for 2 months\n\n[Google Cloud Certified, Professional Cloud Security Engineer](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-cloud-security) intermediate level, recommended 4hrs/wk for 5 months\n\n Google Cloud Certified, Professional Collaboration Engineer \n\n[Google Cloud Certified, Professional Data Engineer](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/gcp-data-engineering) intermediate level, recommended 4hrs/wk for 4 months\n\n[Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-automation) beginner level, recommended 5hrs/wk for 8 months\n\n[Google IT Support Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-support) beginner level, recommended 10hrs/wk for 6 months\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow to apply:\n\n1. Contact your education office for the SkillBridge mandatory briefing\n2. Ask your leadership if they will let you out-process early. No point going through the process if you get immediately denied by your supervisor before going any higher\n3. On the SkillBridge site under locations enter \"Google\" into the search field. Once you decide on the program you want email the POC for more information, to verify your SkillBridge application is correct, etc\n4. Send draft of SkillBridge application to education office to go over it\n5. If Education Office says it is good sign it, then email the Google POC for their signature \n6. Send signed copy to education center. They will then unlock the SkillBridge area in AFVEC\n7. Upload to AFVEC and fill out the required information\n8. AFVEC emails your supervisor for signed approval\n9. Once supervisor signs it will email your commander for approval\n10. Once completely approved you will get a final document that you will use for outprocessing, leave, etc\n11. Contact MPF to get early orders for separation as you need to out-process before you start\n12. Once 60 days from start of program you can submit for PTDY on leaveweb at your preferred location and add the attached SkillBridge approved application along with a 4392 for commander approval\n13. I also recommended submitting for terminal leave at this team\n\nOnce I knew what program I wanted to do, it only took me a little over a week to get everything submitted, signed, and approved on AFVEC\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFAQ:\n\nWhat status will I be while on SkillBridge? You will be on permissive TDY will all applicable rules\n\nWhat are the chances of being approved? The education office and Google will approve you as long as your paperwork is correct and you follow the process. Your supervisor can deny the application, but the ultimate decision lies with your commander\n\nThe program only recommends X time but I want to do longer!- These are recommendations to watch the video one time. If you want to get one of the certs you will probably want to watch the videos more than once, use supplemental resources like qwiklab, find hands on labs, and study your own notes. Personally I intend to use some of the courses from my Cloud Computing degree as supplemental material so I can kill two birds with one stone during this time.\n\nI have no cloud experience and prefer learning hands on- Google cloud has a a free tier and [trial program](https://cloud.google.com/free) starting with $300 credits\n\nDoes anyone monitor my progress- No. It is self paced and up to you to get the most out of this program. Your leadership can decide to ask for updates at their digression, but there is no tracking on how many videos you watch on a given day.\n\nDo I have to complete the certs- No, just the course\n\nDo I have to pay for the certs- This program does not cover the cost of certs, but there are various nonprofit agencies who will.\n\nHow much is Coursera? These courses all appear to be $49/month. There are nonprofits like [Hire Heroes](https://www.hireheroesusa.org/hire-heroes-usa-announces-partnership-with-coursera/) that are willing to cover the cost of one or more courses\n\nCoursera says \"enroll for free on X date\", but isn't it self paced? You can start whenever you want, the button always shows today's date and allows you to sign up for a 7 day free trial.\n\nWhich program should I do? It is up to you to do the research on which program will help you the most with the career path you choose.\n\nWill this guarantee me a job interview? No. This is just a training/accreditation  program. It will help improve your odds though. For a guaranteed job interview look into the [Microsoft Software and Systems Academy](https://military.microsoft.com/programs/microsoft-software-systems-academy/). It is now online and free.\n\nOn the application what should I put for my schedule? You can put whatever hours you want. What matters is that it is at least 40 hours per week, otherwise you will need to still report to your unit until you hit 40 hours. You need to maintain working full time for the military one way or another. Just put 40 hours no matter what, just don't be a dirtbag and abuse the program.\n\nWhat happens when the program is done? You do a end of survey program with the military and go on  your merry way to terminal leave, being a civilian and/or part timer.\n\nCan I combine SkillBridge and terminal leave? You can use both for up to a total of 180 days, and must end on terminal leave. You can take 189 days of SkillBridge and 1 day of terminal. You can do 90 days of SkillBridge and 90 days of terminal.\n\nCan I sell back leave if I do this- no, you must use all leave before you separate with this program. From now until your DOS plan to use all of your ETS leave.\n\nWhat if I found out something useful not covered her? Let me know in the comments, I want this to post to be as detailed and accurate as possible!\n\nYou posted incorrect information and now I hate you! Well, I don't run these programs, I am just a participant sharing my experience. My notes are not gospel, policies change over time. They can also vary by base and military branch.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "AirForce", "subreddit_id": "t5_2roa2", "subreddit_subscribers": 156380, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Self-paced and online Google IT for SkillBridge- what it is and how to apply", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/comments/ndtwrs/selfpaced_and_online_google_it_for_skillbridge/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1621187976.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "yfern0328", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4tqkb", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1620930557, "domain": "self.OMSCS", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/nbnmn5/omscs_ml_vs_moocs/", "gildings": {}, "id": "nbnmn5", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 14, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/OMSCS/comments/nbnmn5/omscs_ml_vs_moocs/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "piQ2UY1iQHz-v7FuXiZErc7_A5Ej0tPXzUsj4NnlKNI", "resolutions": [{"height": 56, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/LN0sn5F6H8GlFpM_oSEY4VTEKE1PW9ZNtoTh42e1Uuw.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3445b378466cc674280bff0c967bbe6ebc9d679b", "width": 108}, {"height": 113, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/LN0sn5F6H8GlFpM_oSEY4VTEKE1PW9ZNtoTh42e1Uuw.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07ef30809c39f8cb2d2a793583dc4978a39465e8", "width": 216}, {"height": 167, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/LN0sn5F6H8GlFpM_oSEY4VTEKE1PW9ZNtoTh42e1Uuw.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbdeaac295fb0061643efbe4be7d60af9d2de89d", "width": 320}, {"height": 335, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/LN0sn5F6H8GlFpM_oSEY4VTEKE1PW9ZNtoTh42e1Uuw.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=178d685cbd49d9bfd5927c7222870998436b0f1e", "width": 640}, {"height": 502, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/LN0sn5F6H8GlFpM_oSEY4VTEKE1PW9ZNtoTh42e1Uuw.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f514492d94ed9eb68a68850994ddc44102598982", "width": 960}, {"height": 565, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/LN0sn5F6H8GlFpM_oSEY4VTEKE1PW9ZNtoTh42e1Uuw.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cecc215d1d870a12d27a10ca6034a368c51bfc48", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 928, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/LN0sn5F6H8GlFpM_oSEY4VTEKE1PW9ZNtoTh42e1Uuw.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=271e03bc89a44b3e7bdb2a9d19f03879c039c875", "width": 1772}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1620930568, "score": 1, "selftext": "How would you say the content of the OMSCS ML Specialization compares (with regards to course content) to taking Coursera Specializations?

I was trying to rush through the learning process. Thanks [u/Standardweasel](https://www.reddit.com/user/Standardweasel/) for the motivation.\n\nThis week\u2019s post is more focused on the mental approach trying to learn while having a full-time job. It\u2019s tough. Debating returning to school for a CS degree while self teaching but already graduated from college with an unrelated degree. Going back and forth on the pros and cons of returning to OSU. I\u2019ve had a few people ask me \"is FCC going to be enough on its own?\" Firstly, I have no idea what I'm doing as i stated in the first post. Second, I don\u2019t think FCC on its own is going to be sufficient at least for me personally. \n\nSomething that I was originally doing for a long time was watching a tutorial without typing the code. Seems self explanatory but at least for me, refrain from even copy and pasting. Type it all out. \n\nAlso, console.log every single function. Mess around with the code and build on every example. Not only will it help you debug your code, but I found it was helpful thinking about the result and what you are passing into the function. There\u2019s 111 on the first JavaScript section, don\u2019t fly through it. \n\n[Another post I\u2019ve found helpful](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9i0pow/graduated_with_a_24_gpa_1_year_ago_after_studying/) about returning to difficult questions and memorizing how to complete them: learning how to learn, the power of recalling and spaced repetition. Eat up the hard questions. \n\nI\u2019ve been learning by starting with FCC \u2013 moving to Edabit for JavaScript practice and then W3 schools for HTML / CSS practice. Like I said earlier I felt I was moving too quickly through HTML / CSS. Going to continue to do these practice examples as I move to different certs to make sure I am not forgetting.\n\nWorkflow so far has been: \n\n\\- FCC course with videos explaining complex sections. Even if I understand it ill watch the videos. This helps me memorize topics; you can hear the way he verbalizes how he approaches the solution, writing the code and logging to the console. \n\n\\- [W3 school](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_exercises.asp) to practice HTML / CSS \n\n\\- [Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenges) to practice JavaScript \n\n\\- During the day when slow at work, watching the CS50 course via EDX. Instructor is phenomenal \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoals for the week:\n\n\\- Finish the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Cert on FCC. \n\n\\- Continue lists on projects I want to build and how I might go about building them with the new material I am learning weekly.\n\n\\- [Learning how to learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) \n\n\\- [Week 0 / Week 1 CS50](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/block-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X+type@sequential+block@2c7524a47b234a47bb5130c257e1edfb/block-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X+type@vertical+block@4d85bb1a8fe64abe8343375ae965db35)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs

Digital Leader BETA exam. I was finally happy to hear that Google had released a foundational exam that was similar to the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam. The only difference is that it wasn't. This was a foundational exam that was more challenging than I was expecting. This exam expects that one\u00a0can explain the capabilities of\u00a0Google Cloud\u00a0core products and services, how they are to be used, as well as describe common business use cases for these cloud solutions. Although not highly technical, I must reiterate... you will definitely need to know a lot of the given services of Google Cloud and what they are used for.\n\nMy high-level thoughts on this exam are as follows:\n\n* I found this exam to be like a junior Google Cloud Architect exam\n* It tests your skills in knowing what Google Cloud solution to use for a given scenario\n* Although being a foundational level course, it really pushes your knowledge of Google Cloud and Cloud Computing.\n* This exam moves past just the basic knowledge of cloud computing and really dives deep into the services on Google Cloud which was impressive.\n\n**(Full disclosure, I create GCP courses at**\u00a0[**https://training.antonit.com**](https://training.antonit.com/)\u00a0**which are focused on teaching in-depth theory and practical hands-on skills, rather than solely concentrating on exams)**\n\n## Exam Preparation\n\n[Google Cloud Adoption Framework](https://preview.redd.it/ce2fncxe7by61.png?width=1390&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1db0cc64321194201fe7ea72fe384525f52c0c47)\n\nI spent about 6-7 hours going through Google's recommended studies using the Coursera courses listed here.\n\n* [**Business Transformation with Google Cloud**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/business-transformation-google-cloud) \n* [**Google Cloud Product Fundamentals**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-cloud-product-fundamentals)\n* [**Google Cloud Adoption Framework**](https://cloud.google.com/adoption-framework)\n* [**Google Cloud solutions**](https://cloud.google.com/solutions)\n\nAll these courses were very well put together but found some of the content irrelevant to the exam and more foundational knowledge for the role of a Digital Leader. I skimmed through alot of the business transformation course and spent more time on the product fundamentals course along with the Cloud Adoption Framework. Having a deep understanding of architecture and solutions design, I also skimmed over the Google Cloud Solutions page. I found the CAF to be extremely well done and pairing this with the Google services needed for digital transformation allowed for a spot-on approach to the questions asked on the exam.\n\n## Exam Structure\n\nThe exam itself was 3 hours long, with\u00a0over 100\u00a0questions, and the question quality was as expected with Google. Very well done with very little need for improvement (some wording issues, but that's about it).\n\nAfter answering all the questions, I was prompted in the end (like all other exams) to review the questions along with those I had marked. I had spent quite a bit of time writing comments and understanding the relevance of the questions, so I was left with about 60min in the end. All in all, the exam structure was pretty impressive.\n\n## Question Topics\n\nObviously, I want to be really careful here re. NDA. What I will do is give a list of things I think you should know - without revealing anything about question content.\n\n* GCDS - Lots of it with Active Directory and LDAP as well as SSO. - know it\n* Few questions on Dataflow\n* Migration for containers, VM's (Migration for Compute Engine, Migration for Anthos)\n* Hybrid connections (Cloud Interconnect, Partner Interconnect, VPN) - know it\n* CI/CD (continuous deployment) using Jenkins, Cloud Build, and Container Registry\n* IAM\n* Resource hierarchy\n* storage transfer service\n* transfer appliance\n* Cloud CDN (just a mention)\n* Machine Learning (Cloud Vision API, AutoML Vision, BigQueryML) - Know the services well\n* Cloud Armour vs SCC\n* Cloud NAT\n* Cloud Load Balancer\n* Migration and when to use Migrate for Compute Engine vs Migrate for Anthos\n* Cloud DLP (PII)\n* Cost Management using Preemptible VM's (or not) - know this!\n* Support levels (Basic Role, Development Role, Production Role)\n* Shared Responsibility Model\n* Cloud Functions and when to use them\n* App Engine - Standard vs Flexible\n* Dataproc vs Dataflow\n* All Databases at a high level - Cloud SQL, Spanner, Big Table, Datastore, BigQuery\n\n## Some Final Thoughts...\n\nThis exam is full of insight when it comes to digital transformation for any organization moving to Google Cloud. I think that this exam really holds a lot of value and am looking forward to this certification being a new standard for entry-level knowledge within Google Cloud.\n\nIt's a step up for all the people in sales roles and in the real world, can see it being an efficient way to assess what's needed for a digital transformation or moving workloads from on-premises to Google Cloud (and even cloud-native solutions) before having to bring in the solutions architects. I have a strong feeling that I will be making a course for this exam in the coming year, as I can see its importance and really think that others can benefit from the learning path of the exam.\n\nKudos to the people at Google Cloud for putting together a fantastic foundational certification which I think was very much needed.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "googlecloud", "subreddit_id": "t5_2zgfk", "subreddit_subscribers": 22484, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Dli-_pzG9Qr9fAwI1PGbsUTZ8wylvwH397Z7sFmqiS0.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 78, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "My Review on the Cloud Digital Leader Beta Exam", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/googlecloud/comments/n97d2s/my_review_on_the_cloud_digital_leader_beta_exam/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1620659954.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "amaigmbh", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_59s5f16b", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1620400413, "domain": "self.artificial", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/n70tbe/rartificial_here_is_the_latest_issue_of_the_iamai/", "gildings": {}, "id": "n70tbe", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#ea0027", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "7f9d5f7e-bffe-11ea-a7c1-0e73cfacb877", "link_flair_text": "Self Promotion", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_metadata": {"inx1vdyjspx61": {"e": "Image", "id": "inx1vdyjspx61", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"u": "https://preview.redd.it/inx1vdyjspx61.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4cbfa4408fecabf229b837117dd6ea240ec79853", "x": 108, "y": 56}, {"u": "https://preview.redd.it/inx1vdyjspx61.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5caec0142dba2eceacaf68f86615a4bf1474e7d6", "x": 216, "y": 113}, {"u": "https://preview.redd.it/inx1vdyjspx61.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ef92a7d65fdf6bf7a03d52e2642b8160a6880fd", "x": 320, "y": 168}, {"u": "https://preview.redd.it/inx1vdyjspx61.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=392daa560bdc2383281d567eddfb5fbee033820a", "x": 640, "y": 336}, {"u": "https://preview.redd.it/inx1vdyjspx61.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9cbb5add3c22994806d883916eaaad519f53a11", "x": 960, "y": 505}, {"u": "https://preview.redd.it/inx1vdyjspx61.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb367039d722bd1fedaf3bc8d6b1034ec39f72c4", "x": 1080, "y": 568}], "s": {"u": "https://preview.redd.it/inx1vdyjspx61.png?width=2052&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85852d0eceb247e1273b5afea686dfe26b712b50", "x": 2052, "y": 1080}, "status": "valid"}, "ytd1v9vmspx61": {"e": "Image", "id": "ytd1v9vmspx61", "m": "image/jpg", "p": [{"u": "https://preview.redd.it/ytd1v9vmspx61.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d98b70e3c711833c791516eaa7afb511f18bd009", "x": 108, "y": 184}, {"u": "https://preview.redd.it/ytd1v9vmspx61.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91c14a0a98696eefdb0553a0f111539b620e319c", "x": 216, "y": 369}, {"u": "https://preview.redd.it/ytd1v9vmspx61.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcc7a5a2dfce92619271bf579cd3bacfa026f7c0", "x": 320, "y": 546}, {"u": "https://preview.redd.it/ytd1v9vmspx61.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=373638a6f1944fb4c2b2d82ccd86b79f336cb5f1", "x": 640, "y": 1093}, {"u": "https://preview.redd.it/ytd1v9vmspx61.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8437d19e955b553b1ec99c62742a4a3eb59ee5fc", "x": 960, "y": 1640}, {"u": "https://preview.redd.it/ytd1v9vmspx61.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f3b7c6874ef0ac580ce9a63c92408115467a4d0", "x": 1080, "y": 1845}], "s": {"u": "https://preview.redd.it/ytd1v9vmspx61.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d0aa40eccb424df29e54a603271bf1386d62d69", "x": 1080, "y": 1845}, "status": "valid"}}, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/artificial/comments/n70tbe/rartificial_here_is_the_latest_issue_of_the_iamai/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1620400424, "score": 1, "selftext": "[Hello there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaEMSKzqGAg), just here to share the [latest edition](https://www.am.ai/en/blog/newsletter-011/?utm_campaign=Newsletter+11+Post+r/artificial&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Reddit) of our i.am.ai Newsletter.

For a second time the gathering is held completely virtual. Researchers from around the world are gathering for poster sessions, keynotes and workshops. Out of 2997 papers, 860 were accepted for the conference. The official **Outstanding Paper Awards** have been awarded for 8 papers of \"exceptional quality\" leading up to the conference. You can find a full list [here](https://iclr-conf.medium.com/announcing-iclr-2021-outstanding-paper-awards-9ae0514734ab).\n\nMeanwhile, Topbots made its own selection of ICLR conference papers, with **\"breakthrough potential\"**. These include the Visual Transformer (ViT), DETR, DeBERTa and Performers papers we previously introduced in this Newsletter. Read more about each breakthrough paper on [topbots.com](https://www.topbots.com/iclr-2021-research-papers/).\n\n\u00a0\n\n## \ud83d\udccd\u00a0More to Come\n\nICLR only marks the beginning of the annual Conference Summer. With the global health situation only improving slowly, more conferences have moved to virtual meetings.
