I'm not too sure how to answer this one. You can do almost anything with Python (except design websites). As I mentioned before, machine learning is almost exclusively done in Python. Apart from that, you could do web development (only the server-side), data analysis, games (simple ones), even make robots if you have the hardware for it. I recommend browsing [the python subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/top/?t=all) which has a lot of cool concepts. This also ties into the next answer.\n2. As I said before, I didn't really take any classes when learning to code. Mostly, if I was having trouble with a bug, I searched it up on Google and copied the best answer into my code. How I **learned** to code is better explained through these few steps:\n   1. I had a problem. For example, I use flashcards for school and didn't want to keep on having to make them.\n   2. I thought of a theoretical solution. For example: wouldn't it be cool if there was a program that could parse some information from (say) a textbook and make it into a flashcard?\n   3. I just searched Google to see if such a thing already existed. Either it didn't, or something similar to it did but had some limitation or issue (e.g not being free). I almost never found an exact solution to what I wanted.\n      1. If it already existed, I just copied all of the code and read through it until I understood what it did. Then I could edit it to see what would happen. If I didn't understand something, i would just search it up.\n      2. If it didn't exist, I would have to make it. For example, I did eventually make the flashcard thing: [http://cardly.srg.id.au/](http://cardly.srg.id.au/), although I've disabled external access, [here's what it's meant to look like](https://imgur.com/a/gSBlgCh).\n\nThrough this process, I become better and better at coding. At first, I completely discarded any ideas that were too complex for me. And that's OK. Later, I was able to at least understand some of the code I copied. That gave me more and more experience. Finally, and now, I can make applications from scratch without having to rely on source material.\n\nThis process might not work for you and that's completely fine - we all learn in different ways. Below I've put some courses that might be of help to you, although I haven't taken any:\n\n* [https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/python](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/python)\n* [https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=python](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=python)\n* [https://www.udemy.com/topic/python/](https://www.udemy.com/topic/python/)\n\nOr you can just search up 'making games with python' or whatever you want to do - often there will be guides that are more tailored to what you want.\n\n# annendum - python resources\n\nHere's some python resources that might be of help to you.\n\n* Python website (to download and install it): [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/)\n* [Repl.it](https://Repl.it) \\- SUPER HELPFUL site where you can run Python, HTML, CSS whatever on their servers.

The downside is it takes a while if you just want to learn DQN, for example.\n\n2) You implement the simplest possible toy example first. For instance, instead of doing DQN, you start out by just doing Q learning. See for example here: https://www.learndatasci.com/tutorials/reinforcement-q-learning-scratch-python-openai-gym/\n\n3) You read more papers, you also read the supplementary materials as they often include implementation details, you ask on stackoverflow if you get stuck on a particular thing, and you just plough on through.\n\nYou can of course always mix and match how you see fit.\n\nAlso keep in mind that papers are often not a very good manual for reimplementing an algorithm. For example, I was trying to implement a variant of k-means from scratch for a project of mine. I followed the description of the paper and never managed to get it to work properly. Then I looked on GitHub and actually found that other people also couldn't get it to work as described in the paper. Eventually I find the original source code on some abandoned website of the research group and voila turns out not in a million years would I have implemented it like that given the description of the paper.

I can only imagine everything you are processing, especially as a first generation student. My first year of college was about 15 years ago now, but I remember feeling very lost and alone my first year. Especially having been homeschooled, I felt like my social skills were nonexistent and like I was behind all of my peers. \n\nLooking back now? It was definitely a transformative experience. I learned a ton, made friends who I still consider to be family, and even met my partner. But at the beginning, I had no way of knowing all that would happen and I was mostly scared. \n\nThere's a few things I wished I had back then. The biggest piece of advice (and you'll hear this a lot because it is true): *Do Not Be Afraid to Ask For Help*. You're already doing that here, so you're off to a good start! \n\n1. Go to your student resource center early on. Let them know you are a first-gen college student. There are resources for people in your situation and there are good people who want to help you succeed. Not everyone, but if someone's not helpful, just sidestep them and keep moving. \n2. Take full advantage of office hours, study groups, and your academic advisor. Seriously, these are soooo helpful. \n3. On that note: practice admitting when you don't know something. It might feel embarrassing at first, but the more you do it, the more it becomes a superpower. It can unlock explanations, introductions, and that all-powerful moment of \"I don't know either, let's figure it out together.\" \n4. Lots of your classmates will feel scared and overwhelmed, too. College is a difficult, but that shared experience can be serious friendship fuel, if you open yourself up to it.\n5. Student portals suck big ole donkey poo. As others have mentioned, this is an unfortunately universal aspect of the college experience. One way to tame the labyrinth is to keep a note with links to pages you use most frequently. That way, you only have to find the page you need once. \n6. Related, get your tools together ahead of time: Google Calendar for your schedule, some kind of note-taking software ([Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is amazing, MS OneNote and Apple Notes are both good), [Anki](https://www.ankiapp.com/) for flashcards.\n7. How to [read for understanding](https://www.cornellcollege.edu/academic-support-and-advising/academic-support/study-tips/reading-textbooks.shtml)\n8. I wish I knew how to learn. I really feel what you're saying about math. Growing up, I was repeatedly told I was \"not a math person\" and as a result became very afraid of it. I work as a software engineer now (I was poli sci and econ in undergrad) so I had to get over that fear. There's an incredible book called \"[A Mind for Numbers](https://www.abebooks.com/Mind-Numbers-Excel-Math-Science-Flunked/30902555239/bd?cm_mmc=ggl-_-US_Shopp_Trade-_-naa-_-naa&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw1a6EBhC0ARIsAOiTkrHZYP9WDBBeI7jaIqEYNdMYtRY9d6-2qz4CbjX7k45NOAmZmPY7HmQaAtbcEALw_wcB)\" by Barbara Oakley (she also teaches it as a free class on Coursera called \"[Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)\"). Holy hell, I wish I'd read this book before college. If you have time, check it out over the summer. She's got a ton of researched-backed strategies for breaking down complex topics and working with that [voice that tells you \"you are literally going to die if you wade into this subject.\"](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/learning-how-to-learn/overlearning-choking-einstellung-and-interleaving-1MpwV)\n\nSeriously, I am excited for you.
