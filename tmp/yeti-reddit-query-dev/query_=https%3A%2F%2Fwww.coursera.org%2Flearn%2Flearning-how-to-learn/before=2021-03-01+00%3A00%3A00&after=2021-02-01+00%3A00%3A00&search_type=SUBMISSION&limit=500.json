Time management is important if you want to get more done in a limited amount of time. The best way to approach time management is to use a system and stick with it rather than trying to change how things work. The internet has made it much easier to learn how to manage time effectively, since there are so many courses available today. The following list contains both paid and free [learning sources](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=time%20management&amp;page=1) that will aid you in learning how to manage time more efficiently and these courses are perfect for all skill levels, whether you are a beginner, intermediate or experienced professional.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you want to learn how to manage your time effectively, the first course you should take is a to-do list. To-do lists can be very useful because they force you to think about what needs to be done and when and how you can accomplish those tasks. To-do lists will also keep you from wasting time on unimportant tasks, freeing up your time to be able to tackle the more important ones.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext on the list is the concept of task management, which is often called time management techniques or productive time management. There are many different productive time management techniques, including the ability to set goals and to chart a plan to reach them. It is important to set specific goals so that you can stay focused and on track. In addition, you must organize those goals in order to be most productive. Some productive tasks include keeping a to-do list, writing a memo to yourself and setting appointments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost time management courses will also focus on personal productivity. Personal productivity includes scheduling time, doing chores based on the schedule and prioritizing. Learning the proper techniques for personal productivity is an important skill in increasing your overall level of productivity. Some techniques that students enrolled in time management courses will learn include: organizing, prioritizing, communicating, staying on task and being responsible. These are just a few techniques that students can learn and use to increase their personal productivity. The more techniques that you master, the better chance you have of increasing your productivity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are several time [management courses](https://paramounttraining.com.au/what-are-time-management-skills/) that teach students the concepts of managing time and managing productivity. Most of these courses have been proven to be excellent course materials that anyone can take and put into practice immediately. Most of them offer valuable information that can make life easier and less stressful. Courses that include topics such as effective communication, time management techniques and goal setting are excellent course materials that everyone should consider taking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you would rather not attend a traditional classroom-based time management class, there are several online courses that you can take to help improve your skills and get additional opportunities. A great mini-course for those who are interested in improving their time management skills can be found with the Time Management Expert. This mini course was developed by one of the best time management experts in the world. Taking part in this mini-course is an excellent opportunity to learn some of the most valuable information ever on how to become more productive and accomplish more with less time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you find that you are overwhelmed by the amount of information on time management available, you may want to consider hiring a personal tutor to help you through the process. Personal tutoring is an excellent way to get all of the information on time management classes that you need, in one convenient online lesson. When you hire a tutor, you will be able to go through the information at your own pace, and will be able to learn at your own pace.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRegardless of which method you choose, being able to manage your time is an important skill to have. If you feel that you are overwhelmed by the amount of information out there, it may be a good idea to seek out some personal tutoring or even consider hiring a personal tutor. When you know what method you are going to use to become more productive, it makes it much easier to stay organized and on track with your work. When you know how to manage your time, you will find that you spend less time doing unimportant activities and that you get more done in a typical day. Learning about time management courses can help anyone become more productive and increase their productivity and their happiness!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "u_braintrainaus", "subreddit_id": "t5_412yko", "subreddit_subscribers": 0, "subreddit_type": "user", "suggested_sort": "qa", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Time Management Courses", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/u_braintrainaus/comments/ltp7vc/time_management_courses/", "created": 1614436061.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "eryisan", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_67c9qepd", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1613793307, "domain": "self.learnprogramming", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/lnykn0/selfstudy_cs_computer_science_course/", "gildings": {}, "id": "lnykn0", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "tutorial", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "761e4870-d980-11e3-8951-12313b0a7479", "link_flair_text": "Tutorial", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/learnprogramming/comments/lnykn0/selfstudy_cs_computer_science_course/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "B4_ahsdGUc10SJzLHweecFSmYeABFgsf1OgZ4W-lTB4", "resolutions": [{"height": 108, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/qstOpRsK69B7Oz-gh5iHYDHgZro4dnr0gkpmV8WE4kw.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b9f286cbeaec6fad4ce472c4d1c83e7de0bc0d1", "width": 108}, {"height": 216, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/qstOpRsK69B7Oz-gh5iHYDHgZro4dnr0gkpmV8WE4kw.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9935a297fe655def03e05e16937316cb63da207", "width": 216}, {"height": 320, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/qstOpRsK69B7Oz-gh5iHYDHgZro4dnr0gkpmV8WE4kw.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b65c22251d55b173e1732f71f92c7343e6beaa79", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 400, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/qstOpRsK69B7Oz-gh5iHYDHgZro4dnr0gkpmV8WE4kw.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=85b0afe2c7176fc69110f516b30a4552f5169017", "width": 400}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1613793318, "score": 1, "selftext": "These are the resources I searched and sorted in the process of learning CS by myself .\n\n My native language is not English, so this is all machine translation.\n\nGitHub:[@eryisan](https://github.com/eryisan)\n\nTwitter:[@eryisanh](https://twitter.com/eryisanh) \n\n[learnprogramming----wiki----faq----getting\\_started](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq#wiki_getting_started)\n\n***\uff08 choose one \uff09***\n\n**\u2460**&gt;!Introductory !&lt;\n\n1.

And, do employers value real-world experience and on-the-job training enough to overlook the lack of a degree on a resume?\n\n## Value of a College Degree\n\nFor the 2020-2021 academic year, the [approximate price](https://research.collegeboard.org/pdf/trends-college-pricing-student-aid-2020.pdf) for one year at an in-state public college is $26,280 (including tuition, room, board, and other fees), for a total cost of $105,120 for four years. Four years at a private institution is approximately $219,520.\n\nClearly, pursuing a traditional four-year degree can add up. However, data from the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/emp/chart-unemployment-earnings-education.htm) (BLS) shows that there are benefits to pursuing a degree.\n\nFor example, people with a bachelor\u2019s degree who were at least 25 years old in 2019 had a total unemployment rate of 2.2%, while those with only a high school diploma had a rate of 3.7%. The data shows that people with a bachelor\u2019s degree had median weekly earnings of $1,248, versus $746 for a high school diploma.\n\nAdditionally, employers are willing to pay a starting salary that\u2019s between 11% and 30% higher for people with a bachelor\u2019s degree.\n\n## Do Employers Require College Degrees?\n\nAccording to a 2017 [Harvard Business School study](https://www.hbs.edu/managing-the-future-of-work/Documents/dismissed-by-degrees.pdf), between 2007 and 2010, job postings listing a bachelor\u2019s degree requirement as a condition of employment rose by 10%.\n\nThe same study also found that in nine out of ten job postings that requested a bachelor\u2019s degree, the posting did not contain different duties or added responsibilities than postings with the same title that didn\u2019t require a bachelor\u2019s degree.\n\nWhy require a degree when the job\u2019s duties and responsibilities are the same no matter how much education an employee has?\n\nThe study found that employers believe that applicants with a college degree are more \u201cjob-ready\u201d than those without a degree. Specifically, employers feel that candidates with degrees possess more hard and soft skills than non-degreed candidates. While the range of \u201chard\u201d skills varied by field, the desired soft skills were generally the same across the board (including verbal communication skills and the ability to mentor other staff).\n\nHowever, at the same time, employers also admit that **possessing a college degree does not guarantee that a candidate will be any better at the job** than someone without a degree. For example, employers feel that productivity levels are no different between degreed and non-degreed employees and that retention rates remain the same between workers with and without degrees.\n\nEven though employers note that having a degree doesn\u2019t guarantee a candidate will be a \u201cbetter\u201d employee, some companies still require that applicants have their degree. This is in spite of the fact that 63% of employers say that the degree requirements make it harder to fill positions, which may be because nearly two-thirds of the U.S. workforce [does not have a bachelor\u2019s degree](https://www.burning-glass.com/wp-content/uploads/Moving_the_Goalposts.pdf).\n\n## Shifting Norms\n\nFor some organizations, proving you can do the work is enough to get you the job without a degree. Recently many **leading companies have changed their mindset about requiring degrees**, including Google, Netflix, Tesla, IBM, Penguin Random House, Bank of America, Hilton, and Apple. In fact, nearly half of Apple\u2019s U.S. workforce [includes people without four-year degrees](https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-ceo-tim-cook-why-college-degree-isnt-necessary-2019-3).\n\nThere are many [high-paying jobs](https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/top-paying-remote-jobs-v2/) and fast-growing careers that don\u2019t require a degree, such as computer programming, product management, and other tech-related positions.\n\nThere are also many non tech-related [jobs that don\u2019t require a degree](https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/remote-jobs-that-pay-well-dont-require-a-bachelors-degree/), including virtual assistants, pharmacy technicians, online advertising and social media roles, customer service representatives, payroll clerks, and more.\n\nHarvard Business School\u2019s study found that 37% of employers rank experience as the most important qualification in an applicant, not educational attainment. When a job is hard to fill, employers are more likely to overlook the lack of a degree when candidates have sufficient experience in place of the \u201cright\u201d education. And in large organizations (those with more than 10,000 employees), experience is more important than a degree 44% of the time.\n\n### Potential Is Important\n\nIt\u2019s not just experience that employers say they value. A [2019 study](https://www.talentinc.com/press-2019-10-07) found that 45% of recruiters and hiring managers say that a **candidate\u2019s potential is the most important aspect** of their application.\n\nBut potential isn\u2019t just the likelihood that a candidate will perform their job duties adequately (or even go above and beyond). Employers define potential as someone\u2019s ability to grow into and beyond the job. They want people who will solve problems for the company and will, in the long run, bring value to their role.\n\n### Next Steps for Jobs That List a Degree Requirement\n\nJob descriptions often state that applicants should have a degree, which can be frustrating for job seekers who know they could be successful in the role even though they lack this credential.\n\nFortunately, **you can still apply** to jobs that say they require a \u201cbachelor\u2019s degree\u201d or \u201ccollege degree\u201d when you don\u2019t have one. If you\u2019re confident you can do the job based solely on your experience and skills, go ahead and apply.\n\nHere\u2019s how to handle this in your application materials. On your resume, in the Education section, add a line such as:\n\n* \u201c10+ years of experience in lieu of a bachelor\u2019s degree,\u201d so the [keywords \u201cbachelor\u2019s degree\u201d](https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/use-keywords-in-your-job-search/) appear on your document.\n* \u201c2 years of coursework completed toward Bachelor of Science in Accounting\u201d if the job posting lists a specific degree requirement.\n\nIn your cover letter, focusing on the positive and **explaining how you meet many of the other requirements** can help you get your foot in the door\u2014particularly if you have relevant experience.\n\n### What to Do When You Don\u2019t Match All the Requirements\n\nStudies have found that many job seekers, especially women, hold themselves back from applying if they don\u2019t match the vast majority of the job requirements. [According to LinkedIn](https://news.linkedin.com/2019/January/linkedin-releases-2019-gender-insights-report), while both genders browse jobs similarly, they apply for roles differently. Women often feel they need to meet 100% of the criteria for a job, while men usually apply if they meet about 60%.\n\nAs a result, women are 14% less likely than men to apply to a job after viewing it and, on the whole, apply to 20% fewer jobs than men. But, despite this, women are 16% more likely than men to get hired after applying for a job!\n\nRather than holding out for those 100% matches, **if your qualifications match 60-70% of what\u2019s listed in the job description, consider applying**. Remember, a job description is simply a wishlist from an employer, and they\u2019ll most likely not wind up hiring someone with all (or even most) of the qualifications.\n\n## How to Get Education and Experience\n\nFortunately, there are alternatives to a traditional degree program that can help advance your education and work experience.\n\n### Community College\n\nSome employers accept two-year degrees from a community college if an applicant can demonstrate they have some of the desired experience.\n\nYou may still need to complete internships to gain additional experience, but you won\u2019t have to spend nearly as much time (or money) on your education in a two-year program. And, when you complete community college, you\u2019ll have an associate\u2019s degree. Several states have programs in place to make [community colleges more affordable](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/loans/student-loans/tuition-free-college/).\n\n### Trade School\n\n[Trade schools](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0241-choosing-vocational-school) train students for a specific career. Using a combination of classroom and hands-on training, **you\u2019ll gain experience and technical skills** in a specific occupation. Like community college, you can complete the program in approximately two years. You won\u2019t have a degree, but you will have a diploma or certificate that proves you successfully completed the program.\n\n### Apprenticeships\n\nAn [apprenticeship](https://www.dol.gov/apprenticeship/toolkit/toolkitfaq.htm#1a) is similar to trade school, only with less school and more on-the-job learning (and earning). Employers agree to train and pay people willing to learn a job or trade.\n\nMost apprenticeships require a high school diploma to enter. Not every career field offers an apprenticeship, but in certain trades, **an apprenticeship can fill in the gap** between not having a degree and not having the required experience. At the end of the apprenticeship, you\u2019ll have a nationally-recognized credential that can help you find employment.\n\n### Volunteering\n\nBeyond giving back to your community or a favorite cause, **volunteering is a great way for you to gain experience**, hone your skills, and prove you\u2019ve got what it takes to get the job done.\n\nFor example, if you volunteered to run social media campaigns for a pet shelter and can demonstrate that your social media posts led to an increase in engagement with your audience, you\u2019re showing a potential employer that you\u2019ve got social media and marketing savvy.\n\n### Virtual Learning and Upskilling\n\nEven before the pandemic increased the popularity of online learning, many people turned to certifications and degrees through a virtual learning experience. [Online colleges](https://www.affordablecollegesonline.org/best-colleges-online/) offer the opportunity to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree, often on a flexible schedule or with lower tuition costs.\n\nProfessional certifications, such as those offered by hundreds of universities and organizations on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and [edX,](https://www.edx.org/) can help you **gain new skills at a low cost** without going through a traditional degree program. [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) offers over 100,000 online courses taught by experts in their field. Online schools such as [Lambda](https://lambdaschool.com/) and [Merit America](https://www.meritamerica.org/), teach programming with no upfront tuition until you land a job.\n\nCompanies often offer their own certification programs. For example, [Google offers programs](https://cloud.google.com/certification/) in cloud architecture, DevOps engineering, and security engineering. [HubSpot offers certification courses](https://academy.hubspot.com/certification-overview) in Social Media and Marketing, Inbound Marketing, and Digital Advertising.\n\n### Finding an In-House Mentor\n\nSometimes you know you want to [work at a specific company](https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/choose-a-company-then-a-job/), but you don\u2019t have the right education or experience to get the job you want.\n\nConsider taking a different role at the company as a way to get your foot in the door. Then, over time, as you learn about the company and network with coworkers, **seek out a mentor who\u2019s in the department or role you want to move into**.\n\nThat person can help guide you on your career journey, giving you advice and suggestions along the way about what education options might be better for your situation or how to gain the right experience and skills to advance your career.\n\n## How FlexJobs Can Help\n\nWhether you have a degree or not, FlexJobs\u2019 mission is to help you find a better way to work.\n\nWith [flexible and remote job listings](https://www.flexjobs.com/jobs) in over 50 categories and heavily discounted career coaching packages, we're here to support our members throughout their career.\u00a0\n\nConnect with our coaching team and talk to an expert about your career path.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "jobsearchadvice", "subreddit_id": "t5_3xrlsi", "subreddit_subscribers": 12, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Education vs Experience: What Do Employers Want More?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchadvice/comments/lkglre/education_vs_experience_what_do_employers_want/", "created": 1613405077.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Worglorglestein", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_16ze6pbw", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1613291128, "domain": "self.askmath", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askmath/comments/ljko3k/trying_to_understand_what_to_use_as_starting/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ljko3k", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#ffb000", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Calculus"}], "link_flair_template_id": "c60d5eb0-3210-11e8-b2d2-0e9f0a6480c0", "link_flair_text": "Calculus", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/askmath/comments/ljko3k/trying_to_understand_what_to_use_as_starting/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "9Qysc-Pk1TDfrAQHg1hQCwjoEOqAOWcAwtm42GFVCZ0", "resolutions": [{"height": 56, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/vjTmJseDBSqbgbYDKw19PW47cXT--xV0vL61MkA3z98.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1750f4fc1315cb085695a6f3afab73cd0b77387f", "width": 108}, {"height": 113, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/vjTmJseDBSqbgbYDKw19PW47cXT--xV0vL61MkA3z98.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08738399a50efd525ac48123fbb1846bf4bc1c6b", "width": 216}, {"height": 167, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/vjTmJseDBSqbgbYDKw19PW47cXT--xV0vL61MkA3z98.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c22dc38ea0f63f8f7d07cd219c71f1ee9c89fdc", "width": 320}, {"height": 335, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/vjTmJseDBSqbgbYDKw19PW47cXT--xV0vL61MkA3z98.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ff2d7d3089341fc2a1b48ae7bfa8640058ddda1", "width": 640}, {"height": 502, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/vjTmJseDBSqbgbYDKw19PW47cXT--xV0vL61MkA3z98.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=404034bea855486a96b1632d27dc67cc9fbd4528", "width": 960}, {"height": 565, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/vjTmJseDBSqbgbYDKw19PW47cXT--xV0vL61MkA3z98.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58dcdde4cd0f2194b1a3be4b457c7959183cbd19", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 928, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/vjTmJseDBSqbgbYDKw19PW47cXT--xV0vL61MkA3z98.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=3471e3bacaa3f5b65df01841da4e98d3d83de6e7", "width": 1772}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1613291138, "score": 1, "selftext": "Not sure if I should ask this on r/askmash or r/learnpython, but I figure since my question is about the calculus aspect, I thought I'd start here.
