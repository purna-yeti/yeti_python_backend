It has to do with learning. The first video is this class explains it well, you are stuck in the path you think is correct. Or to put it like GuyWithLag you are using a model you think is correct. In reality you are skipping the facts that are being shown to you. Watch the first video in this class https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/ (it's free).\n\nThe other thing I have seen slow people down is how they remember things. People that are the fastest at debuging problems that are touching the database, the os, multiple services, networking, and trace them to a simple config in one app tend to remember things by references. They tie every piece of knowledge together by related things.\n\nAnd lastly workflow. Some people just have a bad workflow. Like working in an IDE on a macbook air with low resolution and they have trained themselves to only be able to understand 4-5 lines of code at a time. Where others work with multiple monitors, run logs on one, code on one and reference on the third. Some use tiling window managers, dropdown terminals, hotkeys for everything, mechanical keybords for faster typing etc. If you aren't deciding the workflow that works for you and you just go with the \"default\" you'll always be slower. It's like mac users that don't know about command + space or developers that can't type or people with terrible memory and slow typing skills that still use vim even though everycommand they use costs them multiple seconds.\n\nJust my two cents on it", "created_utc": 1564364416, "gildings": {}, "id": "evb30b0", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_cise84", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_cise84", "permalink": "/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cise84/anyone_else_feel_intimidated_around_fast_coworkers/evb30b0/", "retrieved_on": 1564364418, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "cscareerquestions", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpm", "total_awards_received": 0, "created": 1564364416.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "mr_dicaprio", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_7skqq4", "author_patreon_flair": false, "body": "&gt; I have a math degree and done a common course in basic C++, just before OOP.\n\nThank you for the information\n\n&gt;There are unsupervised and supervised machine learning depends on how much one would like to instruct and interfere the way the machine learns or the decision is made.\n\nI don't think so.

I would suggest reading anything about the topic really. Traditional ML is almost statistics, but in a lighter form. What you wrote about ML can be also applied to statistics, right ?\n\n&gt;i think i am confused with how machine learning works in a slightly more detailed way. some say it is just regression, same say it is just glorified statistics, some say it is feeding in data and the desired prediction to train the model.\n\n [http://www2.math.uu.se/\\~thulin/mm/breiman.pdf](http://www2.math.uu.se/~thulin/mm/breiman.pdf) \n\n&gt;another silly question is that, if i plan to start a more sophisticated development in research and statistics, it seems python is the best language to learn, since it has more libraries and development in machine learning.\n\nMore sophisticated than what ? \n\nPick python, pick R, pick whatever you want.

I'm late self-taught in CS (didn't start until I was 34) and I have no CS degrees, but I'm a full time faculty member in a PhD granting CS department. The best advice I have for anyone going through college is to spend a good portion of your time in college learning how to teach yourself things. That's basically what the best students do. The worst students don't even try. The ones that try and struggle are those who are almost highly dependent upon other people (professors, TAs, tutors, classmates) to explain things to them. The majority of students are somewhere in the middle in terms of how much they can learn on their own. The best students have figured out how to efficiently teach themselves things they didn't already know. And it has a snowball effect -- the more you know, the faster you can learn new stuff. \n\nI probably didn't really learn how to teach myself things until I got to a PhD program (in the humanities field). Before that I struggled with grades. I had something like a 1.3 cumulative GPA over my first two years of college; but grades are not very good indicators of how much you're learning. The most valuable thing I took away from that PhD program was how to learn at a high level completely on my own. \n\nI ultimately had to figure out how to learn without much in the way of resources. But these days there are lots of resources. For example, check out:  [https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) Still, there is some amount of self bootstrapping involved. \n\nUnless you have a severe learning disability, I think just about anyone can complete a CS bachelors program. CS is comparatively not a tough major, but it does require being able to learn on your own quite a bit. For example, it's not possible to cover the complete details to a programming language in a course. So some of that is up to the student to figure out on their own. If you have to wait for someone to explain it and break it down for you, then you're going to be behind. \n\nSelf teaching is also really important in the tech industry.

Do Andrew Ng's course on it. It's fantastic.\nhttps://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning\n* Python: learn how to use Pandas, Numpy, and Scikit-learn first of all.

Watch some of their videos and start making dashboards.\n* Cloud stuff: if you want to be really sexy right now, take a look at Databricks. That shit is probably going to be hot for a while.\n* Deep learning. Ah yes, that one. Keras is super accessible, and TensorFlow is well know. Fast.ai and Andrew Ng's deeplearning.ai are both going to put you on the right path.\n\nAgain, talk to that contact.

It helped me a lot when I went back to school. Link: [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) There is also this book: [The Science of Self-Learning: How to Teach Yourself Anything, Learn More in Less Time, and Direct Your Own Education](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/42847046-the-science-of-self-learning) . \n\nOne more thing to add is that if you are like me and get bored reading, especially if its a topic you don't find that interesting (looking at your ITIL and Project+ !) use the **pomodoro** method. Basically you set a timer for 25 minutes, do your reading or other task, then take a 5 minute break. Repeat 4 times and then take a 30 minute break. I personally use an iOS app called Focus Keeper but you can use a timer on your phone for free or something similar. This method helps me because as I read sometimes I get this mental fatigue and pull to do something else but I just glance up at my timer and see there is 10 minutes left or 3 minutes left and I say to myself \"Oh yeah I can do this for a few more minutes and then I'll get my break\" and then I am able to redirect myself back to my task.\n\nThe WGU Reddit community is pretty awesome and I feel it makes up for not having a brick and mortar campus. Been to several colleges previously and because of this Reddit and a couple Facebook groups I feel for the first time a sense of  camaraderie with my fellow students and I love how encouraging and helpful everyone is with each other.  \n\nAs for IT stuff, you will need either some work experience or a cert to be accepted. I believe most people recommend the MTA cert since its fairly easy to obtain and is low cost. If you search around on this reddit you will see more details. I already had work experience so that is how I was accepted. Plenty of people have started with little to no knowledge and have been successful in WGU's IT college. \n\nAlso acronyms are a part of the IT life....
