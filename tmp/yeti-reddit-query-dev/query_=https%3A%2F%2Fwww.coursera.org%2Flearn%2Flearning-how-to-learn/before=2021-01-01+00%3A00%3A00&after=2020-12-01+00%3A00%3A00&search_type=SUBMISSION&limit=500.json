"&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7mehgn2w3b861.png?width=1078&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=beda7d14af52e31a4c6ff88d31cd07653f2a8127\n\nThanks to [free online courses](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=free), tutorials, and tools, anyone can become a web designer these days. But, how many times have you visited a website and spoken ill about its design? The reason is, poorly designed, cookie-cutter websites do no good than confusing the visitors. This can potentially harm your website\u2019s user experience, traffic, and sales.  \nSo, if you\u2019re looking for some website design tips to get you started, you\u2019ve landed on the correct page.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xn9wcitw3b861.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=279c46cd339c7a10fdc229564ebe2b66e3ac5407\n\nRegardless of what level you\u2019re on, basic web desing tips should never be overlooked. Here are some crucial user-friendly website design rules that you should keep in mind.\n\n* A poorly aligned website equal to a visually displeasing design. Therefore, learning about the [grid system](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_grid_system.asp) comes first. Proper alignment know-how will lead you to a mobile responsive design.\n* 3 fonts for the whole website is sufficient.\n* Don\u2019t make your visitors wander around searching for buttons. Make your navigation easier.\n* Do not ignore image quality.\n* Your responsive site needs to have a conspicuous color cohesiveness. Pick a color scheme. If you have no idea how to pick one, visit [Paletton.com](https://paletton.com/) or [Coolors](https://coolors.co/). Starting a prototype with black and white is another website design tip to remember.\n* The other main website design tip is to use [white space](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/the-power-of-white-space#:~:text=White%20space%20is%20the%20area,or%20even%20a%20background%20image.). This helps you declutter your website.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ckpwon4y3b861.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08957a45501a0c167d1ab6fe388b507ecc9c15b7\n\nAs a rookie to the web design world, you\u2019ll get easily overwhelmed. To avoid this, choose an interesting project to start your venture. For example, you can look up online for [website design ideas](https://www.prolificdigital.co.uk/best-web-design-styles-trends-for-2020/) for beginners.\n\nSome of the smartest website design ideas for beginners include portfolio, hotel, online store, restaurants and charity and non-profit organizations websites.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/020b8rzy3b861.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d1147d5845a8761a07318afdf8a4d99081461ec\n\nDrawing a wireframe of the website you\u2019re going to build is like having a map to a desolated island. Improvising in web designing usually doesn\u2019t end well.\n\nPlanning can give you a vision of what your website will look like. It doesn\u2019t have to be detailed. Just putting the fundamental elements in place would suffice.\n\nYou can get inspiration and good design tips from Dribbble, [CSS-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) and your favourite websites. If you see noteworthy Typography, Navigation, colours, images, animations, etc. save them for later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ip2lqawz3b861.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cbe2db9c38d13bdaa72c78e8f0b03c4bdd26bc6a\n\nHTML can be considered the predominant pillar of a website structure. If you can comprehend HTML, website design will become more convenient. For instance, you can take your first steps at [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) and follow their tutorials.\n\nCSS, on the other hand, is responsible for the presentation of a document that is written in HTML, XML or SVG. Platforms such as [Mozilla ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)can get you started with learning CSS, rules of CSS, how to apply CSS to HTML and much more.\n\n[Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) is an ideal place to learn any programming language with a pre-eminent set of tools, interactive activities and games. You can choose your subject whether it\u2019s HTML &amp; CSS, JavaScript or even Backend technologies like Python, Java, PHP, SQL, etc. chances are you\u2019ll find the ideal course for you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n04n82u04b861.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f6dc26e830087cd3a3add8695f2832b62ac1442\n\nAs a beginner, starting your first project with a\u00a0[website builder](https://www.prolificdigital.co.uk/cms/) might be a wise idea. You can have website design ideas for beginners from a website builder, especially if you have no technical skills. They usually provide the editor, template (design), custom domain name, hosting, email address, and support.\n\nYou won\u2019t need additional software.

Please keep reading (main points in bold).\n\nI posted this earlier in r/learnmachinelearning which seems like a more relevant sub than here, but it saw absolutely no activity. Since this issue is important and I really, really want an answer, I am reposting it here. Anyway, I disgress...\n\nA lot of people (myself included) are bummed that to complete [Andrew Ng\u2019s Machine Learning course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), you must use Octave/Matlab. Thus, **several kind Pythonistas out there have created \u201cwrappers\u201d of sorts around the course whereby, magically, you actually *can* complete the assignments using Python.** [Here is one example of this.](https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments)\n\nI assume these wrappers implement some machinery under the hood which takes in Python syntax, outputs equivalent Octave/Matlab syntax, then submits the Octave/Matlab equivalent to Coursera\u2019s autograder. If that assumption is correct, **it seems totally plausible that multiple students would write functionally equivalent yet different Python solutions, but then the wrapper might map those different solutions onto identical Octave syntax.** For example, the following Python lines...\n\n    3 ** 2\n    3 * 3\n    3 + 3 + 3\n\n...could all be equally represented with the following line in Octave...\n\n\n    3 ^ 2\n\nIf these three hypothetical students submitted three different implementations to the wrapper, but the wrapper converts them all to the same Octave syntax and submits that to the autograder, **it seems the autograder would be more likely to erroneously classify the these identical submissions as having plagiarized each other.**\n\nThis is my concern in a nutshell, that the details of how these wrappers work might inadvertently raise the odds of students using them getting flagged (erroneously) as cheaters.\n\n**Does anyone know if this concern has any merit?** If not, completing the course with these Python wrappers would be a no-brainer. But if so, then the risk seems like it would vastly outweigh the benefit...", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "learnpython", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r8ot", "subreddit_subscribers": 461157, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Alumni of Andrew Ng\u2019s Machine Learning course who completed it with Python: Does using Python increase your odds of being flagged for plagiarism?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/kc9iuv/alumni_of_andrew_ngs_machine_learning_course_who/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1607861125.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "OddDescription1", "author_flair_background_color": "#b8001f", "author_flair_css_class": "jc", "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Physics HRK"}], "author_flair_template_id": "0b820fd2-07a8-11e9-8c13-0eb607f17e34", "author_flair_text": "Physics HRK", "author_flair_text_color": "light", "author_flair_type": "richtext", "author_fullname": "t2_6aatwka8", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1607668188, "domain": "self.SGExams", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/kaxgq3/olympiads_tips_for_prospective_olympiad_dudes/", "gildings": {}, "id": "kaxgq3", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#0079d3", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Olympiads "}, {"a": ":snoo_surprised:", "e": "emoji", "u": "https://emoji.redditmedia.com/hvfzdhf9aezz_t5_3nqvj/snoo_surprised"}], "link_flair_template_id": "01e89dbc-0c33-11e9-80d5-0eb91cdc0050", "link_flair_text": "Olympiads :snoo_surprised:", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/SGExams/comments/kaxgq3/olympiads_tips_for_prospective_olympiad_dudes/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "S0KPKSXrSz63WHjrF2HFA7JdZ2wcrjoP0tSmmjWudwg", "resolutions": [{"height": 108, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/TtyJEJeVoezNrFiT2ggt5CZBXd-pF6dgqbTXK6VntU0.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11862c9a370fa0c9cc7bfb33e2283e57911c70ad", "width": 108}], "source": {"height": 151, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/TtyJEJeVoezNrFiT2ggt5CZBXd-pF6dgqbTXK6VntU0.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=460c8bc13fae4c0a7baff81a4c3fa6bc7c98ffe9", "width": 151}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1607668199, "score": 1, "selftext": "I see that there're loads of people here interested in Olympiads and want to know more about what is it like and how to prepare for it. I'll share what I know:\n\nOlympiads are a first taste to university and research level topics, depending on the aims and scope of each Olympiad. Most common Olympiads expect a uni level or more amount of maturity, so you are expected to understand the material taught, and be able to solve questions that you've never seen before: it's like being able to operate and maintain any vehicle just from knowing how each vehicle is arranged and a few general but deep understanding of gears and cogwheels etc. You're going to need to be creative and use problem solving techniques (yeah you can actually learn them\\*), while accumulating years of knowledge and methods and principles in the respective subject(s).\n\nThere're whole communities dedicated to Olympiads, online and in person. Most are very experienced with new people interested (well most new dudes will ask 'which books to learn' and 'how should I learn them' and other common questions, so if you want a specific answer, do take care to be *very* specific). Don't be too shy to go and ask. I'll link some that I know here: [https://artofproblemsolving.com/community](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community) (maths, physics and chem, but the last 2 are found in the other forums box), [www.physicsforums.com](https://www.physicsforums.com),  and there's some on reddit but they're dead.\n\nMost Olympiad dudes spent years studying thicc books, watching online lectures and doing problems. It's the only way to properly understand a topic and be able to solve problems. They might have an olympiad teacher or tutor, but mostly the teacher will discuss techniques for solving a few example problems, but you are expected to read and do the problems by yourself (of course you can ask the teacher if you are stuck). If you are that kind of person that loves to read for hours on end and learn more and see the world in a different way, go try out reading cool books which doesn't have to be too hard, like Horrible Science and Nat Geo. Most enthusiasts start out by casually learning cool stuff, and then they slowly try more advanced stuff. Eventually they're striving to do better and improve with what is available to them.\n\nAnyways, to start learning for these Olympiads, there're loads of books and resources written that can help you. Since most Olympiads require deep reasoning skills and critical thinking, your best bet is to read college/uni/olympiad books. You can ask people for the prerequisites to read these books. But IMO, if you have reasoning skills of a healthy person, you can easily understand any introductory college/uni book, most of which is good enough for a decent foundation (but there are great ones that supa pr0 olympiad dudes recommend; read them). Just take the effort and time to understand what the text really means (remember that memorizing formulas or questions won't help you much here). As you read the text, be sure to ask yourself 'what is that?' and 'why is that?' to everything that the text said and explained. If you can satisfactory answer both questions, you have a basic understanding of what is going on (brownie points if you can come up with your own explanations)!\n\nIn order for you to be completely sure of you understand the topic to the point where you can understand very different and unexpected situations, you have to solve problems that *use knowledge that you've learnt, but in completely unexpected and creative ways*. That's why I never recommend O Level or A Level books! Past competition problems may use extra knowledge that you haven't learn, so it's not a very good place to practice until you're familiar with the theory needed. The best place is the end of chapter problems in the book (because the author should know what you've learnt already from the book), so that's why a good book is necessary (so ask the Olympiad dudes)! Generally there're a few books that people recommend at each level, so pick one that is at you level (though I'd recommend you learn calculus before physics or chemistry because reading maths and science at the same time is quite hard unless you have good time management)\n\nNow once you've gotten your books and resources to read (which should consist of a general book if you are studying a science olympiad and a few maths resources), you should work through the book at a steady pace. It's better if you focus on reading a few subchapter in \\~2 hour blocks, and *focus as if you are fully immersed in a good novel (anything less will not be as effective)*. Get a quiet environment without distractions (e.g. phone, annoying siblings, bed and other things that will draw your attention away. Preferably done during detention). Make sure you understand what is going on; you're reading for understanding. If you are tired or distracted, you won't make much from your study session.\n\nYou might have heard of techniques like SQ3R and Feynman technique, but the underlying principle in learning is to read effectively, and then check yourself if you have understood by explaining to yourself what is going on (i.e. by asking what and why).\n\nHere're some books and tips if you want to study for physics olympiads (and the attitude for preparing for olympiads, do check it out): [https://knzhou.github.io/writing/Advice.pdf](https://knzhou.github.io/writing/Advice.pdf)\n\nFor maths olympiads, check out the Art of Problem Solving series for a start (and their website). Most maths olympiads use elementary pure maths like number theory and group theory (but in no way are they elementary as in easy!) but you won't see much 'applied maths' like calculus or statistics. You can also go the other way by taking university level maths and trying Putnam prep books.\n\nI'm not entirely familiar with other olympiads, maybe other people here can recommend :)\n\n\\*Problem solving includes thinking outside the box and logic. Here's one to learn the basics of logic: [https://www.coursera.org/learn/mathematical-thinking](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mathematical-thinking), and you can read Engel and Polya if you are into maths olympiads (many valuable problem solving principles in there). Otherwise, you can google 'problem solving techniques'.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "SGExams", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ph6l", "subreddit_subscribers": 63693, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "[Olympiads] Tips for prospective Olympiad dudes", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/kaxgq3/olympiads_tips_for_prospective_olympiad_dudes/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1607668188.0}]
