Two most valuable lessons are your internship and thesis however (if your country is into them) - that's when you learn how real workplace operates. Whereas thesis can be as complex as you want it to be, better universities in my country are all about machine learning recently and offer fairly hard topics to deal with. Eg. here are some subjects from last year:\n\n* Analysis of potential of CUDA architecture and OpenCL framework in multi-core systems for a certain class of complex computational problems\n* Detection of attacks on web application servers based on analysis of application server logs\n* System for Automatic Synthesis of Rhyme Compositions Based on Natural Language Processing Methods\n* Image analysis algorithms in veryfication of websites compatibility with web browsers\n* Data Mining based decision support system for a telecom operator\n* Open-set classification of text documents\n* Real-time multiplayer arcade game with network interface\n* Classification of text documents in Python \n\nSome of these are for bachelor, some are for master's degree.

University's job is to provide you with solid foundations, not to teach you details.

It's something with meta cognitive awareness can be analyzed and figured out, but a much easier route is CBT therapy (or as a fallback DBT therapy), which specialize in that sort of thing.\n\n&gt;2(May I PM you?) Mediation I have always found difficult but it has been the number 1 things recommended to me for sometime. I subscribed to the sub to mentioned and started looking into the virtues mentioned, funny is that more and more recently i have been observed how selfish i have been and what steps need to be taken.(I hope if it is okay with you that I may speak with you more about number this subject)\n\nYes you can.  You don't need permission, but I appreciate the politeness.\n\nDid you grab a copy of the book?  Let's talk over PM about it?\n\n&gt;4&amp;5 Exercise and Vitamins, Something so simple yet easily made complicated. I have to stop viewing them as separate things that my body needs versus what I need.\n\nA lot of meditation is about habit building.  In the same vain, learning how to get in the habit of things makes something once difficult, effortless.\n\n&gt;6 My second favorite one mentioned here because it will be the sneakiest one to cut back on. I will have work cut out indeed.\n\nIt, like above, is habit building, but if it is too hard, compartmentalization works.  That is, keeping your phone in another room until time is ready, and doing your work in a different user account on your computer, or even better if it can be done, having an office.\n\n&gt;7 Now this one grabbed my attention the most, as it was something new to me and fascinated me. I would like to speak with more you about it, if not that is okay mentioning it was enough for me to start a path of interest and therefore learning about it.\n\nYah sure.  This comes into play in the later stages of meditation when meta cognitive awareness comes into play.  It's also a bit basic, but still worth while [Learning How To Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn).\n\nMost of the meta learning I've done I've figured out on my own.  Sadly I haven't seen any books on the subject, but at least to my advantage, it has made me a power house when it comes to research.  I do data analytics and programming for work, so it kind of comes with the territory.\n\n&gt;There are others comments, and they all offer something interesting and helpful, I merely try to respond similar to how I was answered.

Books. \n\n* [*Big Bang*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/131304.Big_Bang) by Simon Singh is absolutely amazing. Covers a lot of ground (not only astronomy and astrophysics, but also some atomic and nuclear physics), is perfect for a high school student with little background. It's a pretty big book, though. It'll take you a lot of time to get through (and make sure you Google stuff you don't understand! don't just keep reading when you're confused) but it's so absolutely worth it. If you have to choose one book from the list, this should be it. \n* [*Death by Black Hole: And Other Cosmic Quandaries*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20663770-death-by-black-hole) by Neil deGrasse Tyson. A lot of short chapters on a wide variety of topics, but very high-quality stuff.\n* [*Measuring the Universe: Our Historic Quest to Chart the horizons of Space and Time*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/816715.Measuring_the_Universe) by Kitty Ferguson. When reading about astronomy, such as the size of the Milky Way or the distance to some star, you might've been wondering, \"hold on... *how the hell do we know that?!*\" This book does a good job of explaining that. One of my personal favorites.\n* [OpenStax Astronomy](https://openstax.org/details/books/astronomy). Might not be as flashy as some popular science books, but is actually pretty good, especially if you're serious about learning the subject but don't want to dive in too deep for now. \n* [*Simply Einstein: Relativity Demystified*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17298.Simply_Einstein) by Richard Wolfson. A while ago I spent lots of time looking for a popular book on special relativity that would be at the right level for my high school students but at the same time not too superficial, and this one is absolutely the winner. \n* [*For the Love of Physics: From the End of the Rainbow to the Edge of Time - A Journey Through the Wonders of Physics*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7841672-for-the-love-of-physics) by Walter Lewin. A smorgasbord of concepts, phenomena, principles, and facts from many different areas of physics. \n* [*The Refrigerator and the Universe: Understanding the Laws of Energy*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1752860.The_Refrigerator_and_the_Universe) by Martin Goldstein. Thermodynamics doesn't sound as sexy as quantum mechanics or general relativity, but it's actually really interesting, and this book is a pretty good popular introduction to it. \n* [*Physics for the Rest of Us*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1106529.Physics_for_the_Rest_of_Us) by Roger Jones and [*Longing for the Harmonies*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/896550.Longing_for_the_Harmonies) by Frank Wilczek and Betsy Devine are very similar books: a fast-paced, densely-packed (and high-quality) tour through modern physics for the layman. The second one is a bit more poetic. \n\nWhatever you do with these resources, I hope that you take it seriously. Don't just study it ten minutes here, ten minutes there. Do it on a regular basis. Make sure to use [good reading strategies](http://www.readingrockets.org/article/seven-strategies-teach-students-text-comprehension) while reading -- it really does make a huge difference. It might sound silly or useless or whatever, but I find so often that many of my juniors and seniors, who are very smart and good at science and so on, simply don't know how to read a popular science book or a textbook -- they'll read it, but when I try to talk to them about it, I find out that they understood or learned next to nothing. It's because they don't realize that reading these kinds of texts with deep understanding is a skill that can be learned and mastered, not something that people just naturally develop when they go through school. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Hope this helps!

Imagine you were there and creating that thing for the first time.  Why did you name it what you did?  (hint:  https://www.etymonline.com/)  What need was there for it to happen?  What is it similar to that existed before it?  (All new things or events are built from previous things/events.)\n\nIf you learn the etymology of the vocabulary, you will not forget what it is called.  If you remember the events that lead up to it, you will not forget it.  If you remember what it is similar to, you will remember its details.  All of these things will stay burned in long term memory.\n\nShort term to long term memory:\n\nThe average person takes 6 seconds of pondering about a thing before it gets committed from short term memory to long term memory.  When I say pondering, I mean curiosity mostly.  This is one of the reasons note taking works so well, because it slows down how quickly you go over the data allowing more to be committed to long term memory.\n\nIt is impossible to skim a thing and maintain its information, without knowing its neighbouring information, so you're not tacking on much.  In other words, how much you can commit to long term memory is capped at a speed limit.  You have to drive slow and be patient.\n\nFor interacting things like playing a guitar or programming:\n\nFirst, you need to get a solid framework.  This is kind of like reading the manual before riding the bike.  It seems pointless, but if you're going to be doing something over and over again, you don't want to have to learn the same thing multiple times.  This means taking notes (or similar) and committing the instructions to long term memory, before performing the action.\n\nTo get really good at a thing, one trick is to realize there is no true perfect in this world.  We can always find a way to make a situation better.  However!  The game of trying to make a thing perfect is a lot of fun.  However, \"perfect\" in this situation means improvement.  So the game is to make something better and better, not to be the best in the world right off the bat.\n\nIf you interview just about anyone who is the best in the world at a trade, they will tell you they aim for perfection, despite knowing it is an impossible goal.  They enjoy the game of improvement so much they never get tired of playing.\n\nFor study tricks and techniques:\n\n1)  Arrogance is a pain.  Don't believe you know anything if you can help it.  The second you think you know a thing your mind shifts from a mode of learning something new to comparing what you know to the author.  This mode of comparison is a) less fun, if not exhausting and b) does not error correct misunderstandings or improve much upon what was previously learned.  This mode of thinking, while good for skimming, is a study killer.  Avoid it at all costs.\n\n2)  https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn is a pretty good class for study techniques and how the mind works when it is learning from a neurological perspective.\n\n3)  Take up meditation.  It increases concentration quite a bit.

Even if it's the smallest thing possible (one line of code, one more word on a page) I make sure that I do it.    \n\n\n2) **Use Pomodoro Timers**: When I do sit down to get work done, I use the Pomodoro technique.  Set a timer for 25 minutes, work on one task until time runs up, go do something else for 5 minutes, repeat.  This makes the task seem much more manageable since I'm \"slacking off\" twice an hour.  Also, it allows me to measure progress in \"blocks\".    \n\n\n3) **F&amp;@# Motivation**:  I don't trust nor rely on my emotions.  There are many days that I don't feel productive but still make sure I do something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4) **Walk before study**:  Walking clears my head like nothing else does.  Every time before sitting down to study I will go on a short walk.  This also helps with forming a habit cue to study.    \n\n\nA book that I wish I got years ago to learn how to study efficiently is [A Mind for Numbers](https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Numbers-Science-Flunked-Algebra-ebook/dp/B00G3L19ZU).  The complimenting Coursera course [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) is something I can't recommend however (moves too slow and the information feels \"dumbed down\"), but the book is excellent.  I'm a 3 times college dropout who is finally succeeding at school at 30, and that book has helped a ton in this regard.    \n\n\nGood luck out there kid and remember, we are all in this together.

Click \"Audit the course\" after clicking enroll in Coursera.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStep #1\n\n[Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) is a course by University of California San Diego. It focuses on how to better learn and avoid procrastination.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStep #2\n\nNow you need to learn the relevant math and stuff.\n\n1. [Statistic and probability](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability) (You will learn that there is no such thing as 100% confidence in statistics.)\n2. [Linear Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)\n3. [Graph Theory](https://www.coursera.org/learn/graphs)\n4. [Digital Signal Processing](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/digital_signal_processing/)\n5. [Take sometime to memorize brain parts.](http://www.brainfacts.org/3d-brain#intro=false&amp;focus=Brain)\n6. Depends on which side you want to study (Don't worry about this now as your course will tell you.)\n\nStep #3\n\nNow you are ready to jump into neuroscience!\n\n1. [Medical Neuroscience](https://www.coursera.org/learn/medical-neuroscience)\n2. [Synapses, Neurons and Brains](https://www.coursera.org/learn/synapses)\n3. [Fundamental Neuroscience for Neuroimaging](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neuroscience-neuroimaging)\n4. [Computational Neuroscience](https://www.coursera.org/learn/computational-neuroscience)\n5. [You can also learn Neural Network (A.I.) now if you have learnt the math above.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning)\n\nStep #5\n\nNow it is time for you to become a scientist! \n\n1. [Scientific Methods and Research](https://www.edx.org/course/scientific-methods-research-urfux-tpres2017x)\n2. Now you can ask yourself what question public have that you as a scientist want to answer. You can do your research from here. Write a scientific journals and then perhaps write a book on it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRemember, it takes discipline to learn something. You are not only are you gonna be learning neuroscience with above steps, you will be learning self-discipline too. Most people who fail is because they lack self-discipline. When you gain self-discipline, you basically win in life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS: Don't try to rush. Instead, sit down and study relaxly. You want to understand every topic well so get yourself a notebook and a pen. Enjoy your journey. \n\nPPS: Get yourself a weekly blog. That way you will have motivation to study the path above.

Like - what is a matrix, how to invert one, what's a derivative and a gradient. Khan Academy is a good place to learn this. \n* it's VERY helpful to know some statistics. Without it you will not be able to analyze how well your machine learning algorithm is even doing. Simple example - say I have a network that has 99.5% accuracy at detecting whether someone has cancer. Does that mean it's a good network? No, it doesn't mean jack shit :P After all I haven't told you that data I have trained it on is 10000 people without cancer and 5 that do have it. Meaning that 99.5% accuracy might very well mean I claimed that 9950 people do not have cancer and over 50 do have it...aka chances that someone I claimed to have cancer ACTUALLY does have one is like 10%!\n* you should have some programming experience. A huge part of ML is not training and then using it but **preparing** data that will be used for training your network. This can mean automatically fetching data from websites, turning images smaller + adding grayscale + blurring them, removing unnecessary characters from your list and so on and on. Basically - read through https://automatetheboringstuff.com/, it actually will teach you necessary basics in this regard. \n\nPersonally I heavily recommend https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning - it's free unless you need a certificate and it attempts to teach you necessary math on top of just teaching machine learning. It's not a replacement for actually taking some classes or reading a book about it but it's way better than majority of resources out there, having weekly quizes. coding homeworks and a dedicated forum in case you get stuck helps a lot too.

Packt bundles are hit and miss. \n\nI will repeat myself from few days ago, you can also find my recommendation list when it comes to Python: \n\nFrankly, these books are not all that good. Packt is not exactly known for quality publishing. They also release multiple books on the same subject greatly varying in overall level. Example - I see 2 books from them on machine learning in this bundle. I also happen to have a 3rd one at home and... it's literal garbage. Not only is it a straight rip off wikipedia at times, it also expects you to know university level math from the start and also happens to go over like EVERY single aspect of this environment (while having time to also explain 10 different algorithms) in 300 pages (it even goes over Tensorflow and Keras in that time :P). Spoiler alert - it fails at explaining even one properly. Frankly this is in fact a recurring problem with this publisher - while SOME of their books are good, plenty are basically taking articles off stackoverflow and structuring them together to form a \"book\".\n\nFor people wondering what they can use however and how to spend this money in a sane manner (note - I &gt;AM&lt; opinionated):\n- for beginners - https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ or https://inventwithpython.com/cracking/\n- if you are interested in Machine Learning - https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning will provide you with an introduction that's better than pretty much ANY book out there, including learning necessary math AND providing coding exercises + quizes... it's also free unless you need a certificate. Afterwards you can follow up with https://www.deeplearning.ai/, this one is for deep learning specifically and touches more advanced topics.\n- Clean Code by Robert C. Martin if you want something to learn how to structure your code, find info on some good patterns and antipatterns etc.\n- Django/web development - http://www.tangowithdjango.com/ is a good one as it shows you how to build an actual web application from scratch. Older versions are free, latest one costs money. There's also https://djangobook.com/ which some people might like and some might hate but it's still one of the most popular resources.\n- Data analysis - Pragmatic Bookshelf has a reasonable book on it: https://pragprog.com/book/dzpyds/data-science-essentials-in-python.

This isn't a missed opportunity - Surely you learned many many things regularly while growing up. Don't focus so much on that aspect! I swear putting effort into not focusing on that will prove fruitful.\n\nAlso consider checking out this fairly quick course on coursera https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/ \n\nI am entirely self educated in many ways. Some college for electrical engineering but I dropped out and taught myself several professions which I have subsequently worked in professionally. I've dealt with MRI / X-Ray systems, programming, IT systems/networking, infosec, agriculture both for food and for aesthetics profitably, mushroom farming, dog training, personal training.\n\nNot saying I made millions in each by any stretch, but without paying for courses and partaking in traditional learning structures I have made huge gains consistently via self education and study.\n\nI started this by learning how to learn, and it is something I regularly follow up on. Also for more inspiration look into dementia / parkinsons / alzheimers research. We are regularly discovering that many pre-conceived notions are wrong. For example recently several studies reproduced significant cognitive gains in elderly patients simply through a 6 month cardio focused exercise routine. IIRC the stats were something like 50% improvement in some benchmarks. I may have even found this study on reddit come to think of it.\n\nBut anyway start training your focus and brain now, by trying to avoid inducing limitations upon yourself! I would not necessarily say its more difficult over time so much as less natural to do for example. Also, I suspect you likely are aware of this but I do wish to specifically state that neurologically speaking older humans are better at creating connections / associations between EXISTING thoughts/ideas/concepts/chunks in our minds. \n\nI think Brain Games did a great episode on this. Younger brains have that plasticity you describe which helps them mold to new foreign ideas faster, whereas elder brains are much more able to draw upon existing knowledge to form NEW connections. IIRC the brain games example that stood out most was word games - re arranging letters in various game contexts such as scrabble or anagrams. \n\nBe inspired! Be positive!
