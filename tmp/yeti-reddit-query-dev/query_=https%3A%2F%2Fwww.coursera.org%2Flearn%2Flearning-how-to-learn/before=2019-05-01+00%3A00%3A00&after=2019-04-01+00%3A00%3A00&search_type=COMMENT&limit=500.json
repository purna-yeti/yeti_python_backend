I totally *get* you. I used to hate \"web development\" in comparison to \"actual software development\", be it DM, AI/ML, Data Visualization etc Computer Science. I used to believe that Science is better than Application/Engineering.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went that way all through my undergrad in India. I used to tinker my own applications and projects for a portfolio over the summer and winter breaks. I learned, on my own, Android App development, DM/ML/Data Visualization in Matlab and R. None of these were taught in my curriculum in my undergrad uni. While, I was offered and suggested time and time again to learn \"web development\" - in PHP, J2EE, .NET etc. I ignored them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was completing Android App development and applying for MS, **the world had shifted from Desktop applications to a really great demand in the Web** (Web Apps - Dynamic websites, Mobile Apps, IoT and Cloud had emerged). The age of Desktop applications and software had come to an end. Everything was on servers and cloud services.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I got into grad school in US. You know what's the first thing they taught us? RESTful Web App development! **The tools that the newest undergrads used were industry standards. Version Control with Git/GitHub, CI/CD with TravisCI, testing etc.** These were the tools of the trade which every student used.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; My area of interests are Data Science, Computer Vision, and Psychology. I tried to get into Data Science but, seniors said that learn Mathematics first. When I tried Computer vision, they said learn linear algebra first. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring undergrad in my third year when Digital Image Processing started, **I had to put to use most of my matrix and vector knowledge to process and manipulate an image's pixels**. We handcrafted zoom filters and colour filters. Knowing how to read, understand and code a mathematical formula into code was the foremost requirement. This understanding is very helpful now to me using the various image recognition and vision APIs from Google for mobile apps etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, when my *real* DM &amp; Data Visualization classes picked up in grad school (I had AI/DM in undergrad final year but entirely theory), **the statistics were so quickly covered a lot of students had to revise or relearn statistics to understand what's being done** in class, even when our class was mostly hands on. That's when I realized how bloody important was maths, even the not so commonly used probability, statistics and calculus. Hell, I took a Bioinformatics class which was one of the classes offered further covering applied DM/Machine Learning into genomics. The first class started with ACTG...adenine etc proteins building the DNA and how its read into a program and ordered or sorted. All CS students who took the class switched to other classes which were unfortunately not focused on DM but other things like computer networks etc. I knew these from 10th grade. I *stuck.* And I loved the course. Even high school biology helped in gaining perspective of data and patterns we were mining.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome students just quit the MS program in two months. Because they were not fluent in Java and couldn't learn or keep up with the class in J2EE etc. **Knowing one or two languages (preferably an OOP language) to a good degree (of skill and comfort) is far more useful than any theoretical topic you can pick up in CS.** The theory will do me no good if I don't have decent knowledge and understanding of the tool/language.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLD/DR:**\n\n&gt;So, now I am just banging head over books. I don't know what to do, I am stuck.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I don't want to waste my summer attending something that I am not interested in, please guide me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\\[Year 1-2\\]** You should *first* focus on one OOP language of your choice (Python, Java etc). In a language learn; \n\n* control flow (loops, if/else etc)\n* data manipulation (file handling)\n* using 3rd party &amp;  standard libraries + reading the documentation\n* using a database system (plus points for remote database or cloud storage)\n* code refactoring + generating documentation + tests etc\n* parallelization (multithreading)\n* some sort of UI (CLI is done by everybody go the extra mile build web UI or desktop GUI).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor your first year, this will be the backbone of your programming career. You learn one type of language (OOP or procedural etc) you can learn all other similar kinds quickly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\\[Year 1-2-3\\]** Your tools and processes should come *second*. Learn why &amp; how to use Git (a version control system), debugger, linter, IDE, profiler, testing/logging suite and CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery, this is the automation part which streamlines all previous tool usage). **This is the fundamental difference between I am a programmer (from a two-hour workshop with blinking toy robot with copied code) and I am a professional/engineer/expert (**[**Obligatory joke**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKorP55Aqvg)**).** Everything about your tools, IDE etc can be found online or on youtube or the documentation which you can follow and learn on your own. Your uni might never teach you. Also, read [New Programmer's Survival Manual](https://pragprog.com/book/jcdeg/new-programmer-s-survival-manual).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\\[Year 2-3-4\\]** *Third*, \"For Science!\". It is not necessary to go for the maths first and then the Comp. Science. There are libraries and existing tools which abstract away a lot of science and maths involved. You'll rarely build an in-memory sorting for thousands of datasets when your database can sort it with extreme efficiency on its own and all you need is to run a one-line query. Pick one very small subset and use case. Build an app for that (building mobile apps is in vogue in comparison to web apps.).   \n\n\nFor example in Computer Vision: Build an app that recognizes and tags fruits.\n\n1. **\\[Y1\\]** Do you know how to build an app? No? Learn how to build an app. Use your Java etc language skills to learn app building.\n2. **\\[Y1\\]** Do you know Java enough to follow how to build an app? No? Learn Java (follow any decent book - I suggest [Head First Series](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Series-Books/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=8456760011)).\n3. **\\[Y1\\]** Do you know how to use a camera on an app or upload an image? No. Learn it from that app's SDK documentation.\n4. **\\[Y1-2\\]** Do you know how to use an existing ML tool to recognize images? No. Learn [Firebase ML Kit](https://firebase.google.com/products/ml-kit) etc online tools. \n5. **\\[Y2-3-4\\]** Do you want to write your own ML model that will recognize only Bananas, cause Mangoes and other fruits are overrated? Yes? Learn Data Mining + Machine learning using [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Tensorflow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite) or start with [R](https://www.r-project.org/) or [Python's scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/). Maybe take an online course? [Machine Learning with TensorFlow on Google Cloud Platform Specialization by Google Cloud](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-tensorflow-gcp?) which will get you a certificate too if you pay for it or get financial aid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGo at your own pace. You can take courses online or by training agencies or follow them on your own with a book (following chapter by chapter especially books which continuously build a project throughout the book slowly adding components to it). I'll suggest you start by building small programs. Then small applications and then eventually bigger systems-wide projects (also called 3 tier or multi-tier architecture).

You can also look at job adds in your area of work and see what skills other employers are looking for, any that you lack? Maybe start there. \n\nYeah, you can learn a language or start a personal project like a book but those usually take more than 3 hours to do properly...your original question makes it seem like you have a random 3 hours to work with, not a set of 3 hour blocks that you regularly need to fill.

[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) is one, but I know there are others. Instead of jumping straight to a writing a book you could consider r/writingprompts, writing fan fiction, or writing sort stories. Its also fun to just think of characters, giving them names, backstories, drawing them in their outfits. \n\nIf reading, writing, and drawing aren't your jam you could try meditation - lots of podcasts to get you started and refocused. You can also pair this with some exercise like getting up and walking to the break room for 5 min every hour. Keeping yourself moving is a great way to keep your mind active. \n\nYou can take up a relatively simple hobby like origami or taking up some of your time by buying and taking care of a few plants at your desk. You could try to learn how to solve a rubiks cube which would be a great way to fill a random 3 hour time block at work. For something bit out of the ordinary you could work on puzzle games, like [this,](https://www.amazon.com/Professor-Puzzle-Einsteins-Disentanglement-Brown/dp/B07BQMSTCT) or lock picking. \n\nAgain, getting personal chores done is another option.

I recently made a [similar post](https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/bbcxpe/learning_path_resources_for_computer_vision_phd/) asking for resources and some sort of learning path. My background is similar to yours (MSc EE, communications and signal processing), only that I found out about computer vision during my Master's and not my Bachelor's. Even our final projects look similar!\n\nMy first suggestion is to consider pursuing a computer vision (or related) program in graduate school. I don't know about the specifics of your country or your economic situation, but getting a job in computer vision straight out of your BSc is going to be almost impossible, especially with your current background (not CS, not ML/DL). If you're going to be learning about CV while working in an unrelated job, you might as well just go for graduate school and focus entirely on CV. \n\nAgain, I don't know where you live, but there are some great MSc programs in Europe (e.g. TUM, ETHZ) with computer vision courses. In the US, pretty much any top university has at least a decent AI/CV/CS related MSc and CV research group. PhDs have fame of being useless, but they are actually quite valuable in AI-related fields because of how novel and research-oriented they are. PhDs are not for everyone, but I would suggest anyone coming out of college and wanting to dive into AI fields to consider it.\n\nAbout \"what to study\", as u/alkasm suggested practicing with OpenCV, Stanford's [CS229](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) (Ng's ML) and [CS231n](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzUTmXVwsnXod6WNdg57Yc3zFx_f-RYsq) (Fei-Fei's DL) and [TUM's lectures](https://www.youtube.com/user/cvprtum/playlists) are all a nice start. Szeliski's book is also a great reference. Regardless of your specific area of interest, I think knowing at least the basics about both visual math/geometry and ML/DL is extremely important. Another set of lectures that I personally recommend are Marc Levoy's lectures on [Digital Photography](https://sites.google.com/site/marclevoylectures/). Those are great lectures and even though they aren't exclusively focused on CV they help you understand how cameras work instead of treating them as a black box.\n\nAdditionally, I recently found this [extensive list](https://github.com/jbhuang0604/awesome-computer-vision) of CV resources, which I haven't gone through yet, but it looks promising.\n\nAs I said in my post, I think it would be great if we could come up with a consensus list of the most relevant resources to start, and put it in a sticky or wiki entry. I also think we should all make an effort to make this sub more active, so I really hope that you stay around!", "created_utc": 1555130743, "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "ekrzonn", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_bcezb1", "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_bcezb1", "permalink": "/r/computervision/comments/bcezb1/what_can_i_do_to_further_my_computer_vision_skills/ekrzonn/", "retrieved_on": 1555130744, "score": 2, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "computervision", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rfzn", "updated_utc": 1555229750, "created": 1555130743.0}, {"author": "graznam", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_39xch8ku", "author_patreon_flair": false, "body": "Wenns dich wirklich interessiert musst dich halt zwingen jeden Tag was zu machen, auch wenn du grad nicht Bock hast und auch wenn die n\u00e4chste Pr\u00fcfung erst in 4-6 Wochen ist.\n\n&gt; als w\u00fcrd ich mir beim Lernen schwer tun und immerhin hab ich bei allen Pr\u00fcfungen \u00fcber 50% erreicht, was dann aber wurscht war weil man 60% braucht\n\n\u00dcber 50% ist halt echt keine Leistung und in dem Fall auch negativ, also vermute ich dass du dir eben beim Lernen schwer tust. \nHab weder Soziologie noch Psychologie studiert, aber ich sch\u00e4tz bei Soziologie reicht vor der Pr\u00fcfung alles gelesen zu haben und dann grob alles verstehen.

If you don't have knowledge of the level of class 11th and 12th math then go and study at khan academy at least 6 hours a day. Buy a premium package at [Brilliant.org](https://Brilliant.org) too and start solving problems there too. These two combined will help develop a genuine interest and ability for mathematics in you and prepare you for higher mathematics. Try to not rush this process. You can catch up with college-level mathematics much more quickly than you can imagine if this base is strong.\n2. If you can do problems of single variable calculus and some basic algebra and don't understand the college level multivariable calc or linear algebra then go to [edX.org](https://edX.org) and enroll in this order - MITx Calculus 1C -&gt; Enginerineering calculus and differential equations -&gt; Differential Equations on MIT OCW -&gt; Linear Algebra on MIT OCW.\n\nCompetitive Programming - \n\n1. Generally, it is a good idea to go for CP with strong command in c++. Although I haven't recommended any specific courses on c++ above if you indeed cover all the above material (especially CS50) you will have the required skill set to learn c++ in record time. After doing those courses just pick up any good c++ book (Balagurusamy, Prata, etc) and try to finish it in a few days. Then get comfortable in programming in c++. This entire process should take about 2-3 months.\n2. After the above just start practicing on sites like codechef, topcoder, hackerearth, hackerrank, etc. Talent can be easily beaten with practice. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote - I could have listed some NPTEL courses and would encourage you to go and check them for any specific topic you have a problem in, but they are all majorly video-based courses. Those MIT OCW, edX, and other courses have the best problem sets, assignments and tests in the world and would make you think and learn more effectively than some videos ever can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTips - \n\n* Those CS courses are really long, like 8-9 weeks long, DON'T try to do more than a week's course in a few days. If the course is 9 weeks long then give 9 weeks to it. Let it settle in you.\n* DON'T EVER try to do more than two courses at the same time. You will fail in both. I can guarantee.\n* All the courses have rich discussion communities and responsive teaching staff. Interact with them, they are the peer group that you expected from your college.\n* Make mathematics your best friend. Believe me, it would pay off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote - If you see yourself as a really weak student, like really really weak, then I would highly recommend you this course -  [https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/home/welcome](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/home/welcome) \n\nStart with this.

You should be able to follow it easily even without solid maths foundation. The other recommendation is a course: [AI for Everyone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone). Andrew Ng is one of the machine learning most known popularizers.

If I meditate for 20 minutes to an hour before I study, I can go for hours before I run out of steam.  Without meditation, sometimes I can do 15 minutes, sometimes hours.  ymmv depending on what your concentration levels are like before meditating.\n\n - Meta-learning.  If you learn things that you will use years later that you took notes on while you were learning it, when you forget something or remember something wrong, you can go back to your notes and see how you learned, allowing you to improve your own learning process.  Unfortunately, this means slowing down to write more, until the benefits are gained.  There are [classes](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) on the subject matter.\n\n - Get it right the first time.  This also seems paradoxical, because this requires slowing down and taking breaks at the right time, to let the unconscious digest what is learned.  This involves not overly skimming but diving deep enough that the information being learned sticks.  It's quicker to learn it slowly once, than quickly multiple times.  This involves patience.\n\n - Generalize what you learn.  When learning from a mistake or scenario, it's easy to learn a better way for that specific scenario.  However, it is a skill to properly apply that lesson to a variety of similar scenarios.  This has to do with how well one can abstract information, and abstraction comes from a solid understanding of the concrete concepts that make up abstractions.  I have to watch out when I explain things, because if I'm too abstract (too generalized) people do not understand what I mean unless I give an example.  I hope this bullet can be understood okay without giving an example.\n\nWhen I started improving how I learn so that I recall more, so I stop learning the same things over and over again, I witnessed a 4x slow down initially, but I paced myself, and once I started understanding the subjects I was learning flawlessly, everything after that has been a breeze.  It's been not only easy, it's been reasonably quick.

It's really good. It'll probably feel pretty basic and too slow at first, but stick with it and really put the techniques to use and you'll get a lot out of it.\n\nThen go back to your physics lessons armed with those techniques and you'll probably find that you absorb the material a lot better.\n\nOne simple, useful concept that I always try to remember is this: if you are studying something and you find something confusing that is a sign that you have conflicting information. Stop and try to identify assumptions you are making about what you think you know and the new information you are trying to understand. You'll almost always find some detail that you though was true but is not.\n\nI'm guessing you, like most of use, have probably picked up a variety of physics-related concepts that you think you understand, but that really have very little depth and probably include a lot of inaccurate details that you haven't noticed before because you've never really put them to the test (such as by trying to learn more detailed models). That's ok, it's normal, but you have to learn to recognize when a concept you think you know is lacking in depth, and how to ask useful questions that will help you to figure out what you need to study.\n\nYou might enjoy reading about Richard Feynman or watching some of his lectures and interviews on YouTube. He's quite good at explaining things, physics in particular, and he has a lot of useful and enlightening things to say about how to avoid fooling yourself (that's part of the problem with thinking you understand something, you probably don't understand it nearly as well as you think).\n\nFinally, on a psychological level, it can help to change your attitude toward the realization that you don't actually understand something. Discovering that you are wrong about something or do not understand it is not a failing, and you shouldn't feel bad about it. That's an opportunity to discover new and interesting things and you should try to treat it as an exciting moment. One of the best parts of learning cool things is that moment of realization when some ideas 'click' together and you understand a concept. Any time you discover you are wrong, or don't understand something correctly is an opportunity to experience that moment. Be excited! Knowing you don't know is one of the first steps toward that moment!\n\nAlso, get enough sleep, exercise a bit, eat good food, drink plenty of water, and make sure you've got fresh air (high indoor CO2 levels will make your mind sluggish).

My parents couldn't afford classes, so I checked the prep books out of the public library (for the main SAT I used Kaplan and Barrons but it's probably worth doing a search for which are considered best), went through all the material, and did all the practice tests. Then I checked out the other prep books and did the tests only from those ones too. I did better than my friends who took classes (though I guess I can't say I wouldn't have done better with a real class).  \n\nI think the practice tests are the most important part, and I'd recommend doing as many as possible--really doing them, not just looking at the questions and the answers.  The other main thing is doing a little bit every day instead of trying to cram it all in at once.  I think the real advantage of formal courses is not really anything about the material or the teaching, but the fact that they force you not to procrastinate.  For some kids that might be really valuable.  \n\nActually, if he's got time, I'd recommend a quick primer on learning strategies before getting into the studying.
