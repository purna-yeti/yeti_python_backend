If you stick with it and **build something**, who knows, you might even be one of his students in 6 or 7 years.\n\nAnd as other have said  **become very well acquainted with linear algebra, multivariate calculus, and probability &amp; statistics.** Mastering those maths will be the difference between landing a corporate job and taking over the world.\n\nAlso find a teacher at your school (I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re a freshman in high school). Either a math, computer science or a robotics teacher or one who teaches something similar. Talk to them after class or after school and tell them how you like coding and ML. I promise they\u2019ll light up and help you. Teachers nowadays are begging for a student, just any student at all, to finally care. \n\nAll that said, you probably could NOT have better timing.

Here are some tips for you and anyone who wants to read my essay lol. I'm really only a first year, but I do think what I say still holds weight.\n\nI think the first thing to look at is your general mindset when studying academics. I generally come in hoping for a high mark in an assessment, rather than just having thinking about just getting by. Sort of like an optimistic mindset vs. a pessimistic mindset. It's sort of like \"Shoot for the moon, even if you miss it, you'll land among the stars\", where it's kind of like if you aim for the hundred, you will at least get an okay mark even if it doesn't happen. This might be easier said than done and I suppose this attitude is cultivated, rather than forced as you become more acquainted with school, but I would suggest if you can, have this attitude.\n\nNext, it's really good to understand how the mind works with learning. Low-intensity study sessions well in advance for a test is much more effective than very high-intensity cram sessions. Considering exams are a week away, now is the best time to do this. This also involves much less stress because while everyone is scrambling, you are calm in contrast, being well acquainted with the content. This kind of stuff is further shown in this online course by McMaster and UCSD (https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) that I highly recommend. There is a bunch of cool stuff on the 'focused' and 'diffused' mode that will change the way of how you go about studying. There are many other little mind tricks that will be very helpful in your studies. I think this will be the most helpful tip that will both help with your stress and academic success.\n\nI think another thing to go about this is that school is always going to be a grind and that you can't be passive about it. I remember that I used to kinda just float by with ok marks and kept having the attitude \"well, I'm going to work hard next semester\". But remember, you are a human with human tendencies, the decision and action of sitting down to study over an extended period of time is a real thing that we have to do with our own being and agency. I realized this when I made friends with a person who was at the top of my HS class and we grinded out English class together with a ruthless teacher. I truly learned what it meant to \"work hard\". Eventually, this attitude sort of sticks with you and things become easier. \n\nHowever, I will say that I am just finding first year at uog to be really easy and I don't think I am that hardcore on my studies, but I do think just being aware of these tips has been very helpful in being successful right now.\n\nHope this helps you become less stressed out and achieve higher success!

If you find it magical then look for machine learning courses like [https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) that explain the theory behind each algorithm you use. \n\nAdmittedly however I don't particularly see why would you need ML for this. Anomalies in your system can be explained as unusual entry method (per employee) or unusual date (both globally and per employee). \n\nSo first you would want to find an average (or median) time people check in. From there you would calculate the absolute distance for each person from that point (in minutes/hours) and define some kind of threshold, eg. top 5% of people whose times differ the most. Repeat for each day, visualize it and you are done. For single employees code won't even change, just that instead of all employees you would just use one (so you take an average of, say, 30 days and look for biggest outliers).\n\nYou sure could use anomaly detection algorithms in machine learning to do it \"for you\", eg. via SVM  but frankly that sounds excessive and won't necessarily give you better results (I mean, it will tell you which employees are abnormal but it actually won't tell you why, it's a black box algorithm).\n\n&gt;Would it be best to write one long file, or split it into a project structure (and if so, how)? \n\nI would split it into a few pieces:\n\n1. there would be a tool that analyzes time data you provided and calculates offsets from the average/median.\n2. there would be a tool that finds records exceeding your predefined threshold\n3. something that imports the raw data\n4. something to visualize your results (probably built on top of matplotlib or plotly)\n\n&gt; Something like using faker to create a learning data set?\n\nWe have a saying in machine learning: \"garbage in, garbage out\". Feeding your algorithm (if you do decide to go machine learning route anyway although I don't see why would you) effectively random data is how you get it to learn that for instance coming to job at 8:00 is abnormal and normal would be 13:00. Although if it's truly random then hours would be spread equally across the whole day and it would pretty much learn that ALL dates are normal as there wouldn't be outliers.\n\nIf you want to actually train a machine learning algorithm you need a real dataset. More specifically, you take around 70% of the dataset to learn and then 30% to see how your system performs (you don't want to test machine learning system on the same data you used to train it, otherwise you might run into a situation known as overfitting. This is what happens when an algorithm would work great on training data but horribly predicts any scenarios that weren't included in your set).", "created_utc": 1573027735, "gildings": {}, "id": "f6opb2o", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_dschxa", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_dschxa", "permalink": "/r/learnprogramming/comments/dschxa/where_to_start_on_machine_learning_project/f6opb2o/", "retrieved_on": 1573027736, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "learnprogramming", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r7yd", "total_awards_received": 0, "created": 1573027735.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "069921d632187c9f78ag", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3df8zy4c", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "body": "i think that's a good idea, and I also think that it's often most helpful to take a really slow-paced approach to learning harmony. Kinda like most jobs, one way to do it would be to get a huge book about, say, plumbing, read the entire thing from start to finish, and then advertising yourself as a plumber. To be sure, there is an enormous amount of important theory in plumbing, and by the time a plumber retires chances are that they have an intuitive understanding of most of those principles.\n\nBut in general, the book just gave them their initial awareness of the existence of principles; it wasn't how they really came to understand them. That real understanding comes from years of repetition and observation, which also happens to be the way you learn the aspects of plumbing which are not theoretical, but are intuitive, like \"where might that smell be coming from\" or \"wheres the best place to start cutting drywall to find this leak\", etc.\n\nSo I think its good to \"learn theory\" by rote to some extent, but like I said, a lot of it is not going to do anything for you unless you are exercising it. For example, if you enroll in college level jazz-focused harmony course where every day you're staring at charts writing down chord functions, you will definitely build up that muscle.

Before you know it you will be spending an hour or more a day focusing on what you intended to focus on, and the more you practice the better you get at practicing, and the better you get at whatever you are practicing.", "created_utc": 1572960959, "gildings": {}, "id": "f6lu6ge", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_drsuko", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_f6lr86r", "permalink": "/r/getdisciplined/comments/drsuko/question_when_i_am_super_busy_i_have_so_many/f6lu6ge/", "retrieved_on": 1572960960, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "getdisciplined", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uzju", "total_awards_received": 0, "created": 1572960959.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "inglorious", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": "beograd", "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "dogodine u pizdu materinu"}], "author_flair_template_id": "d193e35c-4aef-11e2-bf0c-12313b0ce1e2", "author_flair_text": "dogodine u pizdu materinu", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "richtext", "author_fullname": "t2_3vkrx", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Ako imas vremena, pogledaj besplatan kurs na [courseri](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) o najefektivnijim tehnikama ucenja i navikama da ih podrze.", "created_utc": 1572946667, "gildings": {}, "id": "f6licxn", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_dr8dxv", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_f6juzdy", "permalink": "/r/serbia/comments/dr8dxv/rserbia_sveop\u0161ta_diskusija_za_po\u010detak_nedelje/f6licxn/", "retrieved_on": 1572946667, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "serbia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ql0k", "total_awards_received": 0, "created": 1572946667.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "hellowings", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_rctve", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Based on my several years of observations (thanks to the knees trauma and then spine issues, greasy running water, really low temperature in the bathroom), after day 4 of no showering it definitely starts affecting your mood and mental abilities.

Learning to code is similar to learning how to fix a broken toilet, grow tomatoes, or bake a really fancy cake. It's just learning the tools you need and the rules you have to follow to make something work. It's not for everyone, but if you like to solve puzzles or you enjoy building things, you might like it.\n\nI did a brain dump here of everything I could think of, but feel free to PM me if you have questions.  \n\n\nI'm giving advice for Python because I think it's the most beginner-friendly, welcoming programming language to learn. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* This tutorial teaches you some basic Python and lets you run code in your web browser so that you don't need to install anything to get started: [https://www.learnpython.org/en/Hello%2C\\_World%21](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Hello%2C_World%21). It doesn't do a great job explaining the concepts for a complete beginner, but it gives you a little flavor of what code looks like and how it works. Honestly, this one is kind of boring/overly technical but I included it because it will run the Python for you in-browser.\n* Check out some free programming courses on youtube to get started. Here's a good one for Python: [Python for Beginners](https://youtu.be/rfscVS0vtbw). You can also just google for \"python tutorials for complete beginners\"\n* Dedicate a few hours to working through issues with getting your programming environment on your computer set up, and learning some of the basics of coding. It will be very frustrating and discouraging at first. You'll feel dumb. You might have to spend some time googling for more help or tutorials. Eventually, you will be able to write and run a simple program. If it feels fun or at least interesting to get the program working, you probably have the right attitude and personality to be a programmer.\n* If you run into errors, google the error message or search for it on [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/). Usually someone will have an answer\n   * There are also a ton of subreddits for programming where you can get help if googling doesn't work\n* Find a local meetup group to meet people who can help you and give advice on your journey.\n   * PyLadies is good - [https://www.pyladies.com/](https://www.pyladies.com/)\n   * Meetup has local chapters for lots of good coding/tech groups: [https://www.meetup.com/](https://www.meetup.com/)\n      * Search for PyLadies, Women Who Code, Women in Tech, or a general keyword like Python or programming to find groups near you\n* Check out some free programming courses on sites like udemy or coursera to learn more about Python. As with anything else, the paid courses are better than the free courses: \n   * [https://www.coursera.org/learn/python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python)\n   * [https://exercism.io/tracks/python](https://exercism.io/tracks/python)\n   * [https://www.udemy.com/course/teach-your-kids-to-code/](https://www.udemy.com/course/teach-your-kids-to-code/)\n   * Skillcrush is women-owned and offers a free coding intro course: [https://skillcrush.com/](https://skillcrush.com/)\n* Start to think about what kind of coding you want to do. If you like to build pretty things you might be interested in front end web development. If you don't care about making something look good and you just like puzzles, you might like back end development. JavaScript, React, Python, and Ruby are common technologies for this area..\n* If you like it and you want to keep going, there are tons of videos on Youtube about how to find and pick a coding bootcamp. Some coding bootcamps charge you upfront, and others don't charge you until you get a job.\n\nIt's a steep learning curve, and everyone feels stupid or like they will never get it when they start. I know I did. But you really don't have to be a genius or even very good at math to be a good programmer. You just have to be able to think through a problem and keep trying until you get it.\n\nI know several people who went from working in retail, to doing a 12 week or 6 month coding bootcamp, and a year later were employed making 40k-70k in an entry-level software engineering or developer role. It took me longer than that (about 3 years) because I didn't do a bootcamp, I just tried to learn on my own while working other jobs.
