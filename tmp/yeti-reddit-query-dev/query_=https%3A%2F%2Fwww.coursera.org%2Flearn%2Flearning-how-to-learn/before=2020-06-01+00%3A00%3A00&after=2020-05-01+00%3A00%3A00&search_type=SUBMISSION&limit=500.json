This post is a little more targeted towards CS majors since that is my major and it\u2019s going to be about making it to the \u201cbig cities\u201d and the big tech companies since I know a lot of you dream of making it there and at least for me that was my only goal when I came here as a CS major. I managed to get two tech internships out of my time at OSU at Amazon/Microsoft/Google/Facebook/Uber/Lyft/Twitter type companies and I wanted to share a guide on how you should start.\n\nHow can I start?\nIf you\u2019re like me and came into CS without any programming knowledge. You can start by trying to get a decent grip on a language. Since your first courses are likely to be in Java, I would recommend you start by learning Java if you have not started learning another language yet. Plus, tech interviews will require you to code with a chosen language and Java is not a bad choice. Two birds one stone! At this stage in your undergrad career don\u2019t get caught up on learning as many languages as you can, choose one and get some mastery on it.\nI have been told codeacademy is not bad at introducing basic Java, https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java\n\nWhat are tech interviews like?\nThey not always written interviews like this one, but this is not a bad example\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKu_SEDAykw\n\nHow can I prepare for interviews?\nThe crucial skill in tech interviews is mastery of Data Structures and Algorithms\nWhat is data structures and algos? https://medium.com/swlh/introduction-to-data-structures-9134b7d064a6\nThis book is the holy grail of grind for tech interviews\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=sr_1_2?crid=HWCYVQNI7JPY&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=cracking+the+coding+interview&amp;qid=1590547883&amp;sprefix=cracking+the+coding%2Caps%2C258&amp;sr=8-2\nThis book provides little more advanced tech interview practive \nhttps://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Java-Insiders/dp/1517671272/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2XM5HDD94BVLV&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=element+of+programming+interview+java&amp;qid=1590547963&amp;sprefix=element+of+progr%2Caps%2C164&amp;sr=8-2\nYou can practice programming problems here, https://leetcode.com/\nVideo tutorials on DS&amp;A\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmJz2DV1a3yfgrR7GqRtUUA\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKvwPt6BifPP54yzH99ff1g\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/purpongie\n\nWho should I apply to? \nEverything. This list is for summer 2020, but here are just a few companies to consider, https://github.com/elaine-zheng/summer2020internships\n\nShould I even bother to apply for interviews if I am just a freshman/sophomore?\nYes, you should. Even if it means failing badly, the experience you gain is priceless and recruiters (befriend them) often will reach out to you the following year if they have dealt with you before. Worse that happens they say no to you; best that happens you get an intern position at some of the most iconic companies paying $50/hour and a massive boost to that resume. A lot of tech companies have programs meant for underclassmen and underrepresented groups (overrepresented groups still make it in). To name a few programs there is Twitter University, Facebook, Google STEP, Microsoft Explore, Uber Star. Look these programs up this coming fall! While you are at it applying to these companies, apply to everything else you see too. Just apply even if you don\u2019t fit the requirements perfectly.\n\nWhen should I apply?\nASAP this fall. The seats go fast at giant tech companies. By mid september-early october you should be well underway to spam those apps out.\n\nWhat if my resume is too sparse?\nTry doing some projects. Here\u2019s a few courses I took early on that helped me give some filler on my resume. There's mini projects in these courses that I think if you got a basic grip on programming languages fundamentals you could understand the projects just fine even for beginners. Follow along with the project tutorials in these courses and add them to your resume. Even if they are just basic weather apps, todo list apps, flash cards apps, etc they\u2019re still better than most people\u2019s rock paper scissor terminal app made in intro to Java. \nJavaScript/NodeJS, https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/\niOS/Swift applications, https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/\nIf you\u2019re into machine learning and a pretty mathy person, this course is pretty well regarded by the machine learning community, https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning\n\nHow can I show my project to recruiters?\nSome of the courses above go over Git and GitHub, but it would not be a bad idea to post your code on GitHub just to show recruiters and hiring managers you got some initiative. Git is a must have skill to have in the real world! \n\nIs it worth all this extra effort?\nIMO yes. You get to visit awesome cities, have your food and swanky housing paid for, happy hour, meet other interns and get a couple years of tuition paid off in one summer.\n\nYou are at a good school, do not sweat it. At the same time be proactive about learning outside of class because too many people think the degree itself entitles them to a tech job or just have never made anything other than a System.out app. Work hard, study hard, and play hard!

These are 8 reasons that testify to **how important is technology for education**.\u00a0\n\n## Technology revolutionizes education and opens new horizons\n\n[85% ](https://zerocater.com/blog/2018/06/04/workforce-newest-members-generation-z/)of the 21st-century generation said they watched an online video to learn a new skill. The way [Google took over the classroom](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/13/technology/google-education-chromebooks-schools.html)\u00a0and provided modern pupils with personal Google accounts and Chromebooks is amazing. The variety of digital tools that schools and universities use during the COVID-19 quarantine prove **the technology in education** is a safeguard for educators in an emergency.\n\nThe first decade of the 21st century meant that the traditional teaching system has been outliving its reputation as a comprehensive and effective way to learn things. Society now needs personalization, students long for freedom in choosing subjects, universities shift to use of technologies for sharing knowledge and simplifying the lives of professors and students.\n\n## It gave birth to active arousal of online courses\n\nAnticipating the start of online education, universities accumulated their resources, united professors and software development companies into one community that nowadays upholds the great part of Education and declares the future of **digital learning**. The year 2012 marked huge progress in [Edtech ](https://inoxoft.com/industries/education-industry/)and was announced the year of MOOC (Massive Open Online Course). News and social media posts abound with online courses, launched by the world-famous universities, on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [edX](https://www.edx.org/) or [Udemy.](https://www.udemy.com/?utm_source=adwords-brand&amp;utm_medium=udemyads&amp;utm_campaign=Brand-Udemy_la.EN_cc.ROW&amp;utm_term=_._ag_80315195513_._ad_386251995970_._de_c_._dm__._pl__._ti_kwd-310556426868_._li_1030503_._pd__._&amp;utm_term=_._pd__._kw_udemy_._&amp;matchtype=e&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIpJ-ysY7C6QIVCqQYCh0qDwZjEAAYASAAEgJzHvD_BwE) Million people trust them and enroll online, earning certificates and even Master\u2019s Degrees, learning one more language, or coming up with new coding skills. Let\u2019s have a look when and which web solutions for education were launched that nowadays constitute the list of the most well-known ones across continents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/50clnf0i43051.png?width=2001&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01cd8f9ef5b1ab70eeed6128b9865d139711feca\n\n \n\nThe motherland of these and other world-known web sites is the US, namely cities of San-Francisco, New York, Massachusetts, and the United Kingdom. Special merit should be paid to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard, Berkeley, Michigan, Oxford Universities, the Open University and more. As soon as e-learning has earned considerable significance, the edtech projects have received more and more attention from developers and educators. The movement to develop and invest in education was seen as an investment in the future. Since that time the world\u2019s attempts to modernize studies have led to the discovery of holographic lectures, application of AR and VR and strengthening of the role of [Big Data in education](https://inoxoft.com/impact-of-big-data-on-education-history-benefits-and-examples/).\n\n## It means easier access to learning possibilities for everyone\n\nWe fully embrace digitalization as a powerful tool for collaboration, organizing, managing schools and conducting classes. [Top 6 Digital Transformation Trends in Education by Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2017/07/18/top-6-digital-transformation-trends-in-education/#1bb26a202a9a) names Intelligent Tutoring Systems, Artificial Intelligence, AR, VR together with gamification, personalized and blended learning. The education systems across the globe should soon go along with these innovations. Being future-ready in education is rather a must today, especially in conditions of mandatory quarantine. Schools and universities should keep up the pace with online teaching to meet challenges the whole world faces now. As an example, Ukraine has launched [the National Online School Project](https://www.unian.info/society/10936646-ukraine-launching-national-online-school-project.html) where channels are transmitting lessons and children have the opportunity to study at home.\n\nTalking about modernization challenges, it is the technology that we always turn to find advanced solutions. How could we simplify the life of students, professors with copying books and preserve the rare copies forever? Humanity invented electronic books and scanning tools, but[\u00a0Image Access](https://www.imageaccess.de/) in the US goes far ahead. This market-leading company delivers innovative scanners for different formats and serves public libraries across America. The company\u2019s scanning devices allow copying books in a contact-free way. There are art scanners to take a copy of works of art like acryl, oil or watercolour paintings, while flatbed scanners allow putting the book on the glass, not pressing the pages or damaging the cover, and receive copies of different formats in the highest quality.\n\nMore than that, designed scanning devices are also used to access books virtually. There is an [image processing solution for virtual library ](https://inoxoft.com/casestudy/image-processing-solution-for-virtual-library/)giving an opportunity to remotely order the scanner, search a book in a virtual space where you can go through aisles, look at the shelves, click on the book you need and send out for the device that will print it for you at a scheduled time. Amazing it is how thousands of students can study from one rare book that is preserved at the library, just taking electronic copies of it in the PDF format when they wish.\u00a0\n\n## Education quality is largely improved with neurotechnologies\n\nTeachers\u2019 feedback for online learning solutions is quite satisfying and mark the **learning process** with more space for flexibility. However, the greatest concern is the lack of live interaction, communication and direct observation of students\u2019 progress that puts barriers for teachers. Responding to such a challenge, the Ukrainian company has created an application that monitors the effectiveness of online education. [Beehiveor, ](https://beehiveor.com/research#how)which deals with neuroscience and education products, has developed an application with [EyePass technology ](https://eyepass.tech/index.html)that controls eyesight and movement. The algorithm defines whether learners attentively examine materials or just look through. The system also recommends what piece of material a pupil has to return to and revise attentively.\n\n## Artificial Intelligence develops education to unimaginable extents\n\nGeneration Z, born in the mid 90\u2019s \u2013 early 2000\u2019s, put high expectations for a personalized **learning process** and AI is the best tool to meet this demand. Artificial intelligence helps to automate studies, reduce in-class time and accelerate skills acquisition. [Big Data in education](https://inoxoft.com/impact-of-big-data-on-education-history-benefits-and-examples/), application of AI and NLP make learning seamless and data-driven.\u00a0 AI helps to analyze behaviour during classes and detect gaps in learning. Educational technologies built with the help of AI algorithms promote diversity and transform passive learning into activities, social communication and fun. \u00a0Nowadays when meta-cognitive load is strengthened, great results can be achieved with video watching, case studies or brainstorming sessions. Modern studying is all about learning from example, which is possible with [simulation software](https://inoxoft.com/gamification-and-simulation-in-education-and-corporate-learning/), intelligent e-learning AI-integrated apps that encourage critical thinking and tackling challenges faster in a more creative way.\n\n## Facial recognition can provide useful insights for schools\n\n[Facial recognition](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3027349/artificial-intelligence-watching-chinas-students-how-well-can) devices in Chinese schools are becoming a more widespread tool for gathering useful insights and combating security threats. China applies technology not only at schools, but dormitories to register attention and attendance. The next application of AI here is to monitor the teaching process and analyze the performance of students. As a result, there could be a better view on how to improve teaching and maximize the effectiveness of the **learning process**. The technology can understand and differentiate 6 basic emotions \u00a0\u2014 surprised, scared, angry, happy, sad and disappointed. It is targeted to predict aggression and violence as well. However, many European countries stick to \u201cagainst facial recognition\u201d campaigns at schools. The reasons to block surveillance is explained by inaccuracy of devices, unregulated usage and intrusion into privacy of children and creating tension for each pupil, knowing he or she is being watched.\n\nArtificial intelligence and facial recognition still have a room for improvements \u00a0\u2014\u00a0 it can not see faces of pupils wearing different glasses and there are long queues to go through scanning devices after classes. To approve facial recognition is 100% beneficial takes time and better investigation how it influences students\u2019 themselves, their behaviour and learning habits.\n\n## Technology in education enables flexibility and creativity\n\nThe relationship between **technology in the classroom** and creativity expands our consciousness. At the Center of the educational system is STEM, a concept embracing Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. While people think of creativity to be all about the Arts, it\u2019s a mistake we are used to repeating. Creativity is in the heart of science and technology. When we start applying technology as a means of communicating ideas and teaching creative thinking, we will help children reflect and use in real life their imaginative vision on simple things, which adults, unfortunately, lose as they grow up. Maybe one of that future child, allowed to take his or her dreams and realize childish ideas seriously with the help of software, will eventually manage to invent something we\u2019ve never seen before and will become a genius.\n\nGeneration Z has to be educated with technology at hand. It\u2019s natural for them to adjust to Macbooks rather than time-consuming paper writing. They are taught to find quick solutions, but act reasonably and respect the opinion of their opponent.

So maybe my post can give you some insights if you decide to take the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) course. (I took it last year, near the end of 2019)\n\nA little background on my coding experience before taking the course: \n\n* self-learn python through Automate The Boring Stuff and Corey Schafer youtube channel (Can\u2019t recommend him more than enough, he is gold!)\n* self-learn SQL, a little bit of pandas and numpy \n\nThe IBM Data Science course consists of 9 parts, by having experience with python and SQL, you can clear Course 1-5 in about 2-3 weeks assuming you set aside time to do it everyday. It basically will feel like recapping what you\u2019ve learnt. (Courses 1-3 is on understanding how to frame the business problem for data analysis and it won\u2019t take much time to learn).\n\nThe hard part starts to come from course 6 onwards where you learn how to manipulate data using pandas and do your data analysis. Course 6-7 is where you learn how to run exploratory and descriptive analysis on jupyter notebooks and do your plottings using matplotlib, sns, folium etc. If you\u2019ve not touch  on pandas before it\u2019ll be a learning curve for you and yes if you\u2019ve returned your stats back to your college teacher, get it back. \n\nAt this stage if you feel overwhelmed, being someone who decided to enroll into this course without prior experience in python or data analysis, give a pat on your back that you\u2019ve managed to come so far, it is so not easy.\n\nNext, course 8 is where you learn the machine learning algorithms- unsupervised and supervised. If you have 0 knowledge about how ML algorithms work before taking the course, you\u2019ll have to keep revisiting the slides to absorb the information. One thing I didn\u2019t like about this section is, there were mistakes in the tutorials and being a complete newbie, I didn\u2019t know till I see others highlighting in the forum section. So don\u2019t blindly follow, you have to understand what you\u2019re learning. \n\nAfter course 8, congrats! You\u2019re left with the capstone project where you have to come up with a business problem, choose an unsupervised ML algorithm for your analysis and submit your reports.\n\nIt took me slightly under 2 months to finish the course, I worked on it almost everyday. Is this course worth it? I signed up for this course because well, it is by IBM and IBM materials shouldn\u2019t go wrong right? The course runs on a monthly subscription basis at USD39 per month, meaning the faster you finish the course, the less you will have to pay. If you\u2019re thinking of getting this cert to land a data science job, you would still need to do more learning, this course gives you an intro into what data science involves and as what others have shared, you still need to prep for coding interviews by doing Kaggle etc and continue to up your knowledge in this field. \n\nHope this helps!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "datascience", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "subreddit_subscribers": 224535, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "[AMA] I\u2019ve completed the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Course, ask me anything you want to know about the course and I\u2019ll try my best to answer your questions.", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/gjhkjc/ama_ive_completed_the_ibm_data_science/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1589441223.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "thom986", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_hs6m5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1589151548, "domain": "self.Astronomy", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/ghblen/archaeoastronomy_mooc_on_coursera_by_giulio_magli/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ghblen", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/Astronomy/comments/ghblen/archaeoastronomy_mooc_on_coursera_by_giulio_magli/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "-B2RYnvKjSBs2Ixt2k7Wo34JLLs72aNpuisbBK3i_vw", "resolutions": [{"height": 56, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/p9joXGatHld84Wl_zr4I_UomOa5M90G3GgOQbQMxnak.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76cf741edf36ba1daabda43903aff6701ee9ff2f", "width": 108}, {"height": 113, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/p9joXGatHld84Wl_zr4I_UomOa5M90G3GgOQbQMxnak.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91dff6c55c62f6c90848c99ef27aee718a22e157", "width": 216}, {"height": 168, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/p9joXGatHld84Wl_zr4I_UomOa5M90G3GgOQbQMxnak.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46bf9a61b5a59245316b60bd8306184799125e30", "width": 320}, {"height": 336, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/p9joXGatHld84Wl_zr4I_UomOa5M90G3GgOQbQMxnak.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be1d70685ca6cf448bef335bbb15f34111fa8ce0", "width": 640}, {"height": 504, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/p9joXGatHld84Wl_zr4I_UomOa5M90G3GgOQbQMxnak.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd29a251fde1a6782cc5863416ab87221717044b", "width": 960}, {"height": 567, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/p9joXGatHld84Wl_zr4I_UomOa5M90G3GgOQbQMxnak.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9317991d10164b3ea43b69e6e9e60bd1c425ad1a", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 630, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/p9joXGatHld84Wl_zr4I_UomOa5M90G3GgOQbQMxnak.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=dbf67b5b767e33b3f57c82ee1740f8b12cc6fe6a", "width": 1200}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1589152047, "score": 0, "selftext": " I've a master degree on math applied and work as a math teacher on middle school in France.

It is an interdisciplinary  science in between architecture, archaeology, and astronomy. It studies  the relationships between the ancient monuments and the sky, in order to  gain a better understanding of the ideas of the architects of the past  and of their religious and symbolic world. The course provides the first  complete, easy introduction to this fascinating discipline.  \nDuring  the course, many spectacular ancient sites of archaeology \u2013 such as  Stonehenge in England, Giza and Karnak in Egypt, Chichen Itz\u00e1 in the  Yucatan, Macchu Picchu in Peru and the Pantheon in Rome \u2013 will be  visited and the fascinating events occurring there in special days of  the year (such as solstices, equinoxes, or the day of the foundation of  Rome) will be shown and explained. The course also provides the  necessary background on Astronomy with the naked eye and a general  introduction to the role of Astronomy in religion and in the management  of power among ancient cultures. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI completed the first two weeks and found it quite interesting. Nothing really difficult. Test are quite easy for the moment. There isn't so much material (which is a strengh for me).  \n\n\nI hope to follow with : [https://www.coursera.org/learn/astro/home/info](https://www.coursera.org/learn/astro/home/info)  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe programs (7 weeks)  \n\n\nWeek 1\n\nIn   this week we shall learn the basic tools which are needed for studying   Archaeoastronomy. Essentially, this means learning Astronomy with the   naked eye, since the ancients did not have  telescopes, and becoming   acquainted with a simple instrument  - the magnetic compass - and   amazing softwares: virtual globes and digital planetariums.\n\n* Archaeoastronomy: the science of stars and stones 2 min\n* The celestial coordinates and the apparent motion of the Sun 6 min\n* The constellations and the apparent motion of the stars6 minPrecession and the reconstruction of ancient skies 4 min\n* Sightseeing with an archaeoastronomer's eye 4 min\n* Supplementary Course Text 5 min\n* **1\u00a0test : 5 questions**\n\nWeek 2\n\nThe   core of the course: understanding how astronomy, religion, and the   management of power were connected in ancient cultures, and the way in   which these connections are reflected in architecture and landscape   since the Neolithic. At the end of the week we shall thus visit the   places where Archaeoastronomy was born: Stonehenge and Newgrange.\n\n* Astronomy and architecture: a very early connection - 6 min\n* Archaeoastronomy in action: hierophanies and sacred landscapes - 6 min\n* The places where Archaeoastronomy was born: Stonehenge - 6 min\n* The places where Archaeoastronomy was born: Newgrange - 4 min\n* **1\u00a0test : 5 questions**\n\nWeek 3\n\nAn   archaeoastronomical tour in a wonderful land: Egypt of the Pharaohs.  We  shall visit Khufu's (Cheops) Great Pyramid and assist to the   spectacular hierophany which occurs every year at Giza at the summer   solstice. Then, we shall move to the huge temple of Karnak at the winter   solstice, to finally encounter the \"heretic\" king Akhenaten and the   astronomy-related project of his new capital.\n\n* The stellar destiny of the Pharaohs - 5 min\n* The Great Pyramid and the stars - 6 min\n* The horizon of Khufu7 minKarnak, Abu Simbel and the Egyptian calendar - 6 min\n* The Amarna heresy and the horizon of the Aten - 5 min\n* **1\u00a0test**\n\nWeek 4\n\nAn   introduction to pre-Columbian Archaeoastronomy, with key topics such  as  the Maya Calendar, the role of astronomy in Maya architecture, and  the  sacred space of the Incas at Cusco and Macchu Picchu.\n\n* Maya astronomy and calendar - 8 min\n* Chichen Itza and the Serpent Equinox - 7 min\n* The Inca pillars of the Sun - 6 min\n* Macchu Picchu - 4 min\n* **1\u00a0test**\n\nWeek 5\n\nAn   archaeo-astronomical  visit to fascinating places of ancient Asia: the   Xian area, with the Terracotta Warriors and the pyramids of the  Chinese  Emperors of the Han Dynasty, and Angkor (Cambodia) with Angkor  Wat and  the other state-temples of the Khmer Kings.\n\n* The first emperor and the Terracotta Army - 4 min\n* The pyramids of ancient China - 7 min\n* Angkor Wat - 5 min\n* Between sun and waters: the temples of the Khmer heartland - 6 min\n* **1\u00a0test**\n\nWeek 6\n\nA   fascinating travel in Greek and Roman Italy, in search of astronomy in   the project of some of the masterpieces of the classical age, from the   Greek temples of Sicily to the Pantheon in Rome.\n\n* Houses of the Gods: the Greek temples of Sicily - 5 min\n* Aosta and Augustus' power from the stars - 6 min\n* Astronomy and empire at the Pantheon in Rome - 6 min\n* **1\u00a0test**\n\nAstronomy insights\n\nArchaeoastronomy   is not only \"speaking about the Sun and the other stars\". Interest in   the cumbersome, apparent motion of the Moon and in the alternating   behaviour of Venus as morning star/evening star is also present in   ancient architecture, for instance in the Americas. This section   provides the tools needed to investigate in such cases, as well as    insights on the physical effects affecting measures in Archaeoastronomy.\n\n**1\u00a0vid\u00e9o :** Conclusions and perspectives - 5 min\n\n**18\u00a0lectures**\n\n* Lunar phases - 10 min\n* The eclipses - 10 min\n* The change in the rising and setting points of the Moon - 10 min\n* The Moon in Archaeoastronomy -

Models might not perform well and there is a place for overfitting/underfitting.\n\nTherefore, sometimes you might see things like this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j2q8whk2uyw41.png?width=1198&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a70ae224254ea2f19886c952cfb294d2b0d42317\n\nBut be patient, sometimes the model might get smarter \ud83e\udd13 and give you this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eyvhdtp3uyw41.png?width=1208&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60ade63facde47c0ea2c6d1737679ee35b463d6a\n\n## Background\n\nI'm a [software engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trekhleb/) and for the last several years now I've been doing mostly frontend and backend programming. In my spare time, as a hobby, I decided to dig into machine learning topics to make it less *like magic* and *more like math* to myself.\n\n1. \ud83d\uddd3 Since **Python** might be a good choice to start experimenting with Machine Learning I decided to learn its basic syntax first. As a result a [\ud83d\udc0d Playground and Cheatsheet for Learning Python](https://github.com/trekhleb/learn-python) project came out. This was just to practice Python and at the same time to have a cheatsheet of basic syntax once I need it (for things like `dict_via_comprehension = {x: x**2 for x in (2, 4, 6)}` etc.).\n2. \ud83d\uddd3 After learning a bit of Python I wanted to dig into the basic **math** behind Machine Learning. So after passing an awesome [Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) on Coursera the [\ud83e\udd16 Homemade Machine Learning](https://github.com/trekhleb/homemade-machine-learning) project came out. This time it was about creating a cheatsheet for basic machine learning math algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, k-means, multilayer perceptron etc.\n3. \ud83d\uddd3 The next attempt to play around with basic Machine Learning math was [\ud83e\udd16 NanoNeuron](https://github.com/trekhleb/nano-neuron). It was about 7 simple JavaScript functions that supposed to give you a feeling of how machines can actually \"learn\".\n4. \ud83d\uddd3 After finishing yet another awesome [Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) on Coursera I decided to practice a bit more with **multilayer perceptrons**, **convolutional** and **recurrent neural networks** (CNNs and RNNs). This time instead of implementing everything from scratch I decided to start using some machine learning framework. I ended up using [TensorFlow 2](https://www.tensorflow.org/) with [Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/overview). I also didn't want to focus too much on math (letting the framework do it for me) and instead I wanted to come up with something more practical, applicable and something I could try to play with right in my browser. As a result new [\ud83e\udd16 Interactive Machine Learning Experiments](https://github.com/trekhleb/machine-learning-experiments) came out that I want to describe a bit more here.\n\n## Tech-stack\n\n## Models training\n\n* \ud83c\udfcb\ud83c\udffb\u200d I used [Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/overview) inside [TensorFlow 2](https://www.tensorflow.org/) for modelling and training. Since I had zero experience with machine learning frameworks, I needed to start with something. One of the selling points in favor of TensorFlow was that it has both Python and [JavaScript flavor](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) of the library with similar API. So eventually I used Python version for training and JavaScript version for demos.\n* \ud83c\udfcb\ud83c\udffb\u200d I trained TensorFlow models on Python inside [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks locally and sometimes used [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to make the training faster on GPU.\n* \ud83d\udcbb Most of the models were trained on good old MacBook's Pro CPU (2,9 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5).\n* \ud83d\udd22 Of course there is no way you could run away from [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) for matrix/tensors operations.\n\n## Models demo\n\n* \ud83c\udfcb\ud83c\udffb\u200d I used [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) to do predictions with previously trained models.\n* \u267b\ufe0f To convert *Keras HDF5* models to *TensorFlow.js Layers* format I used [TensorFlow.js converter](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/tree/master/tfjs-converter). This might be inefficient to transfer the whole model (megabytes of data) to the browser instead of making predictions through HTTP requests, but again, remember that these are just experiments and not production-ready code and architecture. I wanted to avoid having a dedicated back-end service to make architecture simpler.\n* \ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83c\udfa8 The [Demo application](http://trekhleb.github.io/machine-learning-experiments) was created on [React](https://reactjs.org/) using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) starter with a default [Flow](https://flow.org/en/) flavour for type checking.\n* \ud83d\udc85\ud83c\udffb For styling, I used [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/). It was, as they say, \"to kill two birds\" at once and try out a new styling framework (sorry, [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d).\n\n## Experiments\n\nSo, in short, you may access Demo page and Jupyter notebooks by these links:\n\n* \ud83c\udfa8 [**Launch ML experiments demo**](http://trekhleb.github.io/machine-learning-experiments)\n* \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f [**Check ML experiments Jupyter notebooks**](https://github.com/trekhleb/machine-learning-experiments)\n\n## Experiments with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)\n\n&gt;A [multilayer perceptron (MLP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron) is a class of feedforward artificial neural network (ANN).

They are used for machine translation, speech recognition, voice synthesis etc.\n\n## Numbers Summation\n\nYou type a summation expression (i.e. `17+38`), and the model predicts the result (i.e. `55`). The interesting part here is that the model treats the input as a *sequence*, meaning it learned that when you type a sequence `1` \u2192 `17` \u2192 `17+` \u2192 `17+3` \u2192 `17+38` it \"translates\" it to another sequence `55`. You may think about it as translating a Spanish `Hola` sequence to English `Hello`.\n\n* \ud83c\udfa8 [Demo](https://trekhleb.github.io/machine-learning-experiments/#/experiments/NumbersSummationRNN)\n* \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f [Training in Jupyter](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/v2/gh/trekhleb/machine-learning-experiments/blob/master/experiments/numbers_summation_rnn/numbers_summation_rnn.ipynb)\n* \ufe0f\ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f  [Training in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/trekhleb/machine-learning-experiments/blob/master/experiments/numbers_summation_rnn/numbers_summation_rnn.ipynb)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/rix288wjuyw41.gif\n\n## Shakespeare Text Generation\n\nYou start typing a poem like Shakespeare, and the model will continue it like Shakespeare.

Therefore, the main plan is to **continue learning and experimenting** with deep-learning challenges and approaches. The next interesting challenges to play with might be:\n\n* Emotions detection\n* Style transfer\n* Language translation\n* Generating images (i.e. handwritten numbers)\n* etc.\n\nAnother interesting opportunity would be to **tune existing models to make them more performant**. I believe it might give a better understanding of how to overcome overfitting and underfitting and what to do with the model if it just stuck on `60%` accuracy level for both training and validation sets and doesn't want to improve anymore \ud83e\udd14.\n\nAnyways, I hope you might find some useful insights for models training from [the repository](https://github.com/trekhleb/machine-learning-experiments) or at least to have some fun playing around with the demos!\n\nHappy learning! \ud83e\udd16", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "learnmachinelearning", "subreddit_id": "t5_3cqa1", "subreddit_subscribers": 153881, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/HYPVaRjcD4YPdtkGgdN8wxOVd1OAUHS2XutH2fOMXts.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 70, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "\ud83e\udd16 Interactive Machine Learning Experiments", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/gdzv8h/interactive_machine_learning_experiments/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1588692664.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Novaxel", "author_cakeday": true, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3kwh6d", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1588424645, "domain": "self.TheAuthenticModel", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheAuthenticModel/comments/gc64bt/free_courses_certifications_habits_and_hobbies_to/", "gildings": {}, "id": "gc64bt", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#46d160", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "05789778-85c9-11ea-a0a3-0e78f301a163", "link_flair_text": "Personal Dimension", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/TheAuthenticModel/comments/gc64bt/free_courses_certifications_habits_and_hobbies_to/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1588424646, "score": 1, "selftext": "Given our recent discussions of skill sampling, it seems like it may be helpful to create a master list. Below is an inventory of various classes, certifications, hobbies, or habits that you can learn each month. Most of these are entirely free resources as well.\n\nThe list is organized by domain, and, by its nature, will always be incomplete. There's no way I can find everything there is, so if you know of any free (or cheap) information that can be added to the list, let me know! This way, this can become a massive resource for anyone looking for something to add to their routine.\n\nEach domain is further organized into informational learning (courses and certifications), hobbies (usually more creative learning), and small habits that can gradually improve your quality of life. Though, I would definitely recommend considering using this time to develop a keystone habit. I've written about the four main ones ([**reading**](https://theauthenticmodel.com/all/reading), [**fitness**](https://theauthenticmodel.com/all/fitness), [**meditation**](https://theauthenticmodel.com/all/meditation), and\u00a0[**journaling**](https://theauthenticmodel.com/all/journaling)) in the past.\n\nIn general, there a few great places online (that show up repeatedly here) that offer free learnings:\u00a0[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=free),\u00a0[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/courses/search/?src=ukw&amp;q=free),\u00a0[Alison](https://alison.com/),\u00a0[Google](https://skillshop.exceedlms.com/student/catalog/browse),\u00a0[MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm), and\u00a0[Harvard](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/catalog).\n\nAny items that are\u00a0*not free*\u00a0will be denoted with an\u00a0**\\***.  \n\n\n# THE BODY DOMAIN\n\n## CLASSES AND CERTIFICATIONS\n\n* **Nutrition**: Alison has many free courses that can teach you the\u00a0[ins-and-outs of food](https://alison.com/courses/nutrition). These also provide you with certifications to boost your resume.\n* **Fitness**: Alison also has several\u00a0[fitness certifications](https://alison.com/courses/fitness?type=certificate)\u00a0for no cost. It's a great way to learn a new skill while also gaining a certification.\n* **Happiness**: As someone who's studied the topic extensively for years, I'd highly recommend Yale's course on happiness (technically the\u00a0[Science of Well-Being](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being)).\u00a0\n\n## HOBBIES\n\n* **Meditation**: The team over at Headspace is offering several free\u00a0[guided meditations](https://www.headspace.com/covid-19)\u00a0during the pandemic. This is great for relieving the stress that may come with this sudden shift in lifestyle.\n* **Calisthenics**: Bodyweight exercise is a fantastic form of functional fitness. You can do it almost anywhere, and, at its higher end, is incredibly impressive. Chris Heria's YouTube channel has several\u00a0[calisthenics workouts and tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheMiamiTrainer).\n* **Running**: Jogging is excellent stress relief, and programs like\u00a0[Couch-to-5K](http://www.c25k.com/)\u00a0make it accessible to anyone, regardless of your current fitness level.\n\n## HUMBLE HABITS\n\n* **Mental Nourishment**: I'm a massive supporter of striving to continually learn new things. But, it doesn't need to be a monumental endeavor. Take 10-15 minutes during lunch or a walk to listen to a TED Talk or Personal Development audiobook. It's a small enough duration to be palatable, but it adds up.\n* **Hourly Activity**: Get up and move every hour, even if it's just 2-3 minutes. It helps keep your blood from pooling and can swiftly add up to 30-60 minutes of activity per day. (So, if you've turned this feature off on your smartwatch, I'd recommend turning it back on).\u00a0\n* **Savor the Moment**: It's easy to get caught up in day-to-day life and miss the intricacies of the world around us. Take a few minutes each day to really savor an experience. Notice all the flavors and textures of something you're eating, or be conscious of the world around you while taking a walk. Alternatively, change your notification sound on your phone; whenever the novel alert sounds, remind yourself to ground yourself in the present and genuinely recognize the things around you.\n\n# THE ENVIRONMENT DOMAIN\n\n## CLASSES AND CERTIFICATIONS\n\n* **Computer Science**: Harvard offers an\u00a0[introductory computer science](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science#!)\u00a0course for free online. Though, if you'd like a certificate, it costs 90USD. MIT has a\u00a0[Java course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-092-introduction-to-programming-in-java-january-iap-2010/), and the University of Michigan offers\u00a0[Programming with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python). If you'd like to try learning\u00a0[C and C++](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-s096-introduction-to-c-and-c-january-iap-2013/index.htm), MIT offers that as well. CodeAcademy can provide\u00a0[180 hours of coding instruction](https://www.codecademy.com/)\u00a0for free. (I can personally vouch for CodeAcademy; you can learn the basics of web development in about seven hours).\u00a0\n* **Real Estate**: This is definitely the most pricey item on this list, but a\u00a0[real estate license](https://www.realestateexpress.com/)**\\***\u00a0can be obtained pretty quickly and lead to a decent salary.\u00a0\n* **Creating iPhone Apps**: Udemy offers a\u00a0[free tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/course/iosdevelopment/?dtcode=YQNLw8T3biSU)\u00a0on this topic. Although Apple provides its own app to\u00a0[teach you their code](https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/)\u00a0as well. I haven't used it yet, but it's lined up as my June skill, so I'll update this afterward!\n* **Graphic Design**: Adobe has a pretty comprehensive selection of tutorials for all your\u00a0[Photoshop](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/tutorials.html)\u00a0or\u00a0[Illustrator](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/tutorials.html)\u00a0needs. Similarly, Udemy also has a bunch of\u00a0[free graphic design courses](https://www.udemy.com/courses/design/graphic-design/?price=price-free&amp;sort=popularity).\n* **Entrepreneurship**: Learn how to\u00a0[start a startup](http://startupclass.samaltman.com/)\u00a0with a Stanford course and then\u00a0[how to fund that startup](https://www.coursera.org/learn/startup-funding)\u00a0with Coursera. MIT has a course on\u00a0[Law for the Entrepreneur and Manager](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-615-law-for-the-entrepreneur-and-manager-spring-2003/).

They also offer classes that can teach you about\u00a0[Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/academy/), a useful skill for any entrepreneur.\n\n## HOBBIES\n\n* **Licensed Radio Operator**: Becoming a\u00a0[radio operator](http://www.arrl.org/ham-radio-licenses)\u00a0is pretty cheap. However, I hear that the hobby can be pricey once you get into it. Fair warning.\n* **Pick Up an Instrument**: Learning to play an instrument is a tremendously productive replacement for habits like video games. The feeling of accomplishment when you master a song or technique is unparalleled.\n\n## HUMBLE HABITS\n\n* **Financial Triage**: Fix up your financial health by creating a budget and sticking to it. Apps like Qapital can help to gamify your savings and round up purchases to the next dollar, adding the excess to a savings account.\n* **Sunday Prep**: Use your Sunday to streamline the rest of your week. Take care of any grooming, cleaning, meal prep, and laundry that you'd typically do during the week. You can even go grocery shopping or write a to-do list for the week. It allows you to keep your momentum and get everything done quickly. Plus, it helps to free up your more stressful weekdays.\n* **Long-Distance Plan**: Charge your phone in a different room from your bedroom each night. It'll help you fall asleep faster and get out of bed quicker in the morning. And, cleaning up your\u00a0[**sleep hygiene**](https://theauthenticmodel.com/all/sleep)\u00a0can have incredible benefits.\n* **Clean Sink**: It's a little discouraging to wake up to a sink full of dishes. Take care of them the night before so you can wake up stress-free.\n* **Quick Morning**: Lay out everything you need for the morning the night before. This could be gym clothes, a glass of water, or prepping the coffee maker. This lets you get going much faster. In general, downing a glass of water is a great way to do first thing in the morning.\n* **Create Go-Kits**: A couple months back, a Reddit user discussed the habit of making \"[go-kits](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/fkruds/i_create_togo_kits_for_every_portion_of_my_life/)\". The idea is to organize a few different bags for different occasions. These bags are always packed and really help simplify your life. Essentially, they're a \"bug-out bag\" for events like work, the gym, travel, grooming, and things of the like.\u00a0\n\n# THE INTERACTIONS DOMAIN\n\n## CLASSES AND CERTIFICATIONS\n\n* **Social Media Marketing**: Buffer has an intriguing email class that teaches you the\u00a0[basics of marketing on social media](https://buffer.com/email-courses/social-media-101)\u00a0in just two minutes a day.

MIT has\u00a0[Spanish I](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/global-studies-and-languages/21g-701-spanish-i-fall-2003/)\u00a0for free. Maybe you're more into\u00a0[German](http://www.deutsch-lernen.com/learn-german-online/beginners/summary.php), though. You can also learn the\u00a0[essentials of Italian](http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/italian/talk/)\u00a0pretty quickly with the BBC.\n* **Ordained Minister**: This one is a bit random, but if you want to marry your friends, you can become an\u00a0[ordained minister](https://www.ulc.org/)\u00a0for free through ULC.\n\n## HOBBIES\n\n* **Reading**: Reading is a great way to learn how to improve your social skills. Services like\u00a0[Audible](https://www.audible.com/)\u00a0or\u00a0[Scribd](https://www.scribd.com/)\u00a0offer free 30-day trials, and audiobooks can be an easy way to ease yourself into the habit. For some recommendations, you can check out my\u00a0[**Recommended Reading**](https://theauthenticmodel.com/all/recommended)\u00a0list.\n\n## HUMBLE HABITS\n\n* **Just One**: If you're feeling low-energy and can't force yourself to do anything, try to just do the simplest thing you can. Throw out one piece of trash, write one sentence, or read one page. If you want to stop after that, go ahead. A lot of the time, even one thing can provide enough momentum to get started. But, if not, that's okay. Be easy on yourself, because you did one more task than you would've otherwise.\n* **Spreading Smiles**: Compliment one person each day. Everyone likes a genuine compliment. It takes 30 seconds, and you could literally make someone's entire week.\n* **Old Friends, New Tricks**: It's easy to fall out of touch. Pick one time a week to call up a friend and catch up. They'll definitely appreciate that you're thinking of them**,**\u00a0and it'll help feed your socialization.\n* **Condition Yourself**: Anyone familiar with dog training knows that it's critical to stimulus and response as quick as possible. (That's why clickers are so effective; you teach the dog to associate the click with getting the treat, which allows you to bridge the gap between command and reinforcement). So, you can invest in a clicker for yourself to reinforce your good habits, or snap a rubber band on your wrist to discourage bad habits.\n* **Relationship Maintenence**: With any problem, proactive prevention beats a reactive solution. Take 15 minutes each week to talk with your partner about how they feel about the relationship. Ask about any potential stressors or concerns. Make sure that you're familiar with\u00a0[**healthy methods of communicating**](https://theauthenticmodel.com/all/communication)\u00a0so that everything goes smoothly.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "TheAuthenticModel", "subreddit_id": "t5_2kl7ig", "subreddit_subscribers": 1, "subreddit_type": "restricted", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Free Courses, Certifications, Habits, and Hobbies to Help You Grow!", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheAuthenticModel/comments/gc64bt/free_courses_certifications_habits_and_hobbies_to/", "created": 1588424645.0}]
