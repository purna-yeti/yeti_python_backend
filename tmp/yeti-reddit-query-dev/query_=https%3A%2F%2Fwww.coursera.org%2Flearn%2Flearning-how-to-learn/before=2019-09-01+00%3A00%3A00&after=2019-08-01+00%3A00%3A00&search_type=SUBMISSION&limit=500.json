First noticed this during my AL days. I would not understand anything taught in school but will get good grades in final exams. This kinda baffled my teachers who think I never pay attention in class. The real problem was that I never learned things at the phase they taught in school. At home I could read and practice a concept over and over again until it solidifies.\n\nThis problem was not only for academic learning. When I go to any class to learn a new skill eg : martial arts, rowing, driving etc, I had to repeat moves many number of times than anyone else in the class. The instructors would complain that I don't pay enough attention. But I do pay my maximum attention. It's just that I have to repeat it that many times. Apart from that I don't remember directions at all. I cannot remember how to go to a place even if I go there a hundred times. Has to use google maps to go anywhere. Those days I was tested with a psychologist for learning disabilities but they said they couldn't diagnose me with a recognized disorder. (Like dyslexia )\n\nAnway I ended up with 3 A's and a B for Core mathematics, Biology, Chemistry and Physics for my AL's. This was after tremendous effort since I had to study things over and over again because I will forget them quickly. Afterwards, I was too burned out and decided to not do science or tech for college and went in for a Finance degree.\n\nThe workload was manageable but after one month I hated it. At the same time, I followed the [Coursera course Learning how to learn by Dr. Babara Oakley](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn). It teaches how many people are capable of doing STEM subjects with proper study techniques. So, after some research, I switched to a CS major.\n\nAlong the way, I learned plenty of study skills that made life bearable. For example, Anki flashcard software lets me put something in memory. I dabbled in mnemonics but didn't find much success there. For example, I can't use loci technique because I don't remember locations to begin with!\n\n# My experience with learning programming\n\nI worked for 12 months in a company as an intern during my third year. The main advice I got both in person and online about learning frameworks was not to try to memorize anything in programming. Also, don't try to make notes. Just refer to the documentation when needed. You will automatically memorize the libraries you are working with most often. But the issue with me is that I never learn anything like that unless I actively try to commit it to memory.  So, against common advice, I decided to memorize programming syntax with anki.\n\n[My Anki decks](https://imgur.com/gUtvRy8)\n\nHowever, this became too overwhelming. There were too many cards. And I saw that there was no point in memorizing something that I only use rarely. So, I changed my way. I put to anki only the fundementals of a library/framework or things that will be needed frequently. Rest of the things I put into methodical onenote notebooks. For example this is my notebook section on ndArrays in numpy library.\n\n[OneNote notes about ndArrays](https://imgur.com/yaA10oq)\n\nAgain, someone would argue that this is a waste of time. I could always refer to the documentation rather than making these notes. But for me, this is what works. Having things organized in a way that makes sense to me.\n\nAnd this is my notebook on Machine Learning.\n\n[Onenote notes about machine learning](https://imgur.com/svMWGBg)\n\nThis is the notebook I used to record things in my last project at work\n\n[Onenote notebook about work project](https://imgur.com/HoRQVnv)\n\n# Self-doubt\n\nAll my life I was full of self-doubt that mainly stemmed from my learning difficulties.  To sum up I don't learn things easily by naturally doing a task. I have to actively commit things to memory using techniques like flashcards or maintaining methodical notebooks. Both these are considered ineffective in programming.\n\nI somehow manage to get the tasks done at work although with methods that are considered weird by others in the field.  Would like some feedback. Are there others like me who have to make notes or actively memorize things? Is this practice sustainable in the long run?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "cscareerquestions", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sdpm", "subreddit_subscribers": 267619, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Is programming/software engineering not suitable for a slow learner?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565020768, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/clxw9c/is_programmingsoftware_engineering_not_suitable/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1564934386.0}]
