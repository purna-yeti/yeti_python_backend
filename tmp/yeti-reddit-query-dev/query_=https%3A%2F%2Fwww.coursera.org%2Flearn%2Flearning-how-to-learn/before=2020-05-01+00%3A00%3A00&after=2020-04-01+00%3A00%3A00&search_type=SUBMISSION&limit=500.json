The post was heavily upvoted in spite of critical comments before it was deleted by the author. The principle criticism was that it was wholly unrealistic to learn the topics listed in the time available.\n\nThis post seeks to provide something more realistic\u2014resources which in 12 weeks give you a flavour of data *analysis* with Python and a basis for further learning. Important notes:\n- 12 weeks is nowhere near enough to become familiar with a language to the point of being consistently productive. You will get syntax errors. You\u2019ll have to google. You\u2019ll get dismayed at the callousness of stackoverflow users. This is normal and doesn\u2019t indicate failing on your part\u2014this takes a lot of time.\n- Total time spent learning is important, but so is frequency. If this takes 12 weeks full time(ish), it might take 30 weeks part time because you forget things more quickly.\n- Business domain knowledge is super important; if you\u2019re learning stuff for a particular industry, try to get hold of data sets for that industry, and feel free to skip stuff if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s relevant (though at this level little is irrelevant)\n\nWhen Ptolemy I asked Euclid if there was a quicker route to learning his work, Euclid  is purported to have responded:\n\n&gt; There is no royal road to geometry\n\nSo it is with data science. If this stuff was easy and quick, data scientists would be paid (\u00a3/\u20ac/$)10/hour.\n\n## Credentials\nI\u2019m a data scientist with a maths PhD (unrelated to stats, but somewhat algebra-focused) and was a quantitative analyst before that. I work in the energy industry and spend a lot of time working with generalized additive models for time series forecasting, chucking stuff at random forests, doing Bayesian inference with pymc3, and survival analysis with lifelines. I don\u2019t use a lot of Tensorflow or PyTorch because they tend not to fit the domain of my problems well, but I revisit them every few months to pit them against our existing models.\n\n### Disclaimer\nThis post is purely my opinion, and I\u2019m particular reflects my view that too much data science is more complicated than necessary, perhaps because people don\u2019t have sufficient grounding in traditional statistics. In *my* work, this is hugely important; if you\u2019re wanting to identify pictures of cats, it really isn\u2019t!\n\n# Learning Resources\n## Python Basics\nNothing here is specific to data analysis, so just take a look at the [r/learnpython FAQ](https://reddit.com/r/learnpython/w/index?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf).\n## Data Analysis\nThere\u2019s no getting away from the fact that mathematics is at the core of data analysis, but you don\u2019t have to be John Conway to be useful. In addition, statistics is by far the most important at this level and you don\u2019t need to understand the minutiae of the subject (which is based in measure theory and is *tough*). Unfortunately I\u2019ve never found a good introduction to statistics with Python (there are plenty for R!), so you have to dip into a number of different resources.\n\n### [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)\nJake VanderPlas is the author of the excellent [altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) plotting library and a pretty bright chap. This book serves as a good introduction to NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Scikit-Learn, and the link includes its full text as Jupyter Notebooks, which is awesome. You needn\u2019t bother with the Scikit-Learn chapters unless you want to jump ahead.\n### [All of Statistics](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/all-of-statistics/)\nPerhaps not *all*, but Larry Wasserman has written a very approachable introduction to statistics here. The link includes the few data sources given in the book, but it\u2019s very much a textbook. At 500 pages it\u2019s a bit daunting, so I recommend focusing on chapters 1\u201311 first, then the chapters on linear regression and multivariate models, which is about 200 pages total. Read along with the [SciPy docs](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/); in addition take a look at [pythonfordatascience.org](https://pythonfordatascience.org/inferential-statistics/) which calls out useful functions in SciPy and statsmodels.\n### [OpenIntro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/book/os/)\nAn alternative (and possibly a better alternative) to AoS, this textbook is available with an optional contribution, and used by a number of colleges in the U.S. I\u2019ve not read it, but a closer look, it appears to be pretty great. As with AoS you\u2019ll have to read along with the SciPy and statsmodels docs.\n### [Python for Data Analysis](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920050896.do) and the [pandas docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html)\nWhich of these you prefer is largely a matter of preferring one medium over another, but PfDA\u2019s second edition is already slightly outdated for pandas 1.0.3, though certainly not enough that it\u2019s not a very useful resource.\n### [Data Science from Scratch](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/data-science-from/9781492041122/)\nJoel Grus\u2019s book kinda *does* do what I assert isn\u2019t possible\u2014take you from zero to data scientist hero in a relatively short text. The criticism I would level at it is that it (necessarily) doesn\u2019t go into sufficient depth everywhere, but what it does brilliantly is implement most things from scratch (duh!) to give you a good grounding in the basics.\n### [Anatomy of Matplotlib](https://youtu.be/6gdNUDs6QPc)\nThis is a great video to get a better understanding of how to work with Matplotlib, which is definitely the least Pythonic library still in use by data analysts today. It\u2019s also slightly outdated, but hugely valuable.\n### [Introduction to Survival Analysis \u2014 lifelines docs](https://lifelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Survival%20Analysis%20intro.html)\nGreat introduction to survival analysis, which will either help you look like a superstar or be completely irrelevant.\n### [Winning with simple, even linear models](https://youtu.be/68ABAU_V8qI)\nI was at this talk at PyData London a few years ago and it was the best of the conference in my opinion. Vincent makes the argument that people are too quick to leap to ML/DL methods when simpler models could do as well or if not better.\n\n## Data Science\nBriefly, here\u2019re a few resources that cover data science proper, but don\u2019t expect to get here any time soon!\n- [r/datascience](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/wiki/resources?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) (includes all the other resources in this section)\n- [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/) and [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/) (the former goes into more detail on the maths than the latter)\n- [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387310732)\n- [Andrew Ng\u2019s Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)\n\n## Data Sources\nAs mentioned before, if you\u2019re interested in a particular industry then see if you can get data related to it. Otherwise, these are some general sources of good-quality data.\n- [Scikit-Learn data](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html) has some really good \u2018toy\u2019 datasets that are useful for playing around with descriptive and inferential statistics, besides the skl estimators\n- [data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk/) and [data.gov](https://www.data.gov/) have hundreds of thousands of data sets. Many of these offer a great opportunity to practice cleaning up data with pandas because they come in all shapes and sizes\n- [OpenIntro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/data/) data sets used in this textbook", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "learnpython", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r8ot", "subreddit_subscribers": 345347, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Data Analysis Resources for Python", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/g89tmh/data_analysis_resources_for_python/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1587883914.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "disciplinedpanda", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_22fuhjds", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1587694946, "domain": "self.getdisciplined", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/g705ba/method_my_ultralearning_project_part_2/", "gildings": {}, "id": "g705ba", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/getdisciplined/comments/g705ba/method_my_ultralearning_project_part_2/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1587694948, "score": 1, "selftext": "Two weeks back, I posted about my first Ultralearning project:\n\n [https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/fxzypi/method\\_my\\_first\\_ultralearning\\_project/](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/fxzypi/method_my_first_ultralearning_project/) \n\nPurpose of this post is to update my progress and share my experiences of Ultralearning approach. \n\n**Progress**\n\nRecently, I completed 4 more courses on Coursera which are part of two specializations. \n\n**Context**\n\nMy online classes started two weeks back. Every weekday, I am having 3-4 classes. I am constantly bombarded by assignments and quizzes. I also need to prepare in advance for classes. Added to that, I need to be in top 10% of my class in order to maintain my scholarship next academic year. \n\n**Motivation**\n\nAfter seeing the pandemic and job market, I got worried. However, I decided to turn my worries into motivation. Now, I want to learn more. I also started to spend 1 hour daily to prepare for a bank exam (minimum commitment) since last 3 days. \n\nDuring the initial days, I was motivated by the deadline of Coursera subscription. Now, I am the state of \u201cflow\u201d. I have to thank the universities for designing their courses at just \u201cright difficulty\u201d. If the courses are too easy or difficult, it is difficult to attain this flow.\n\n**Thoughts on Ultralearning**\n\nI found Ultralearning approach useful. For example, if you go to Coursera, you will find recommendation of spending 3-4 hours per week on a course. This idea is cool but learning requires challenge. You constantly need to stay at the edge of comfort zone in order to maximize your gains. \n\nSecondly, waiting too much time can diminish your motivation and flow is lost. Look at any specialization on Coursera, you will observe a pattern:\n\n1st Course \u2013 2000 reviews\n\n2nd Course \u2013 1500 Reviews\n\n3rd Course \u2013 500 Reviews\n\n4th Course \u2013 250 Reviews\n\n**Retaining**\n\nAs the classes started last week, I got many chances to apply my skills. \n\nWriting\n\nWriting skills are helping me in my assignments, and case studies. One of the faculty already commented on slight change in my writing style.  \n\nExcel\n\nAlthough I was actively using excel before, I learnt many features, functions and shortcuts from the courses I took. Some of the functions were time-saving and made my work efficient (optimization). I learnt how sometimes weird combination of functions can actually solve common problems. \n\nData Analytics / Tableau\n\nI just got my student license of Tableau after ID verification. I have to start this weekend. Earlier, my focus was on finance but now, I am also leaning towards a career in data analytics. Previously, I completed a 5-week course on Data Analytics and learnt basics of Minitab. The sudden shift to Tableau is due to many job descriptions demanding Tableau, MS Office and SQL.  \n\n**Goal**\n\nMy first and foremost aim is to earn certifications. Next, I want to replace each of these certificates with projects i.e. create a small portfolio for myself by the end of next academic year. \n\n**A suggestion**\n\nIn video games, it is easy to feel motivated due to Score boxes, XP and Levels. In real life, there are no scoreboards, XP or levels to visualize progress. We give up easily because we feel things are not moving. \n\nOne of the suggestions I got from the book Atomic Habits (not sure) is the idea of \u201cVisual Progress\u201d. The idea is to make bunch of small slips. Each slip should contain a small task. Divide your goal into small tasks (depending on your comfort level). For me, watching one Coursera video or reading one topic from textbook are comforting. Each time, you complete a task, take out the slip and put it inside \u201cprogress jar\u201d. The progress jar will slowly start to get filled and it will remind you of how far you have come. \n\n**Links to Courses**\n\n1.

Meditation is a rapidly growing practice recommended by everyone from Arnold Schwarzenegger to Lebron James. Spending time isolated from our loved ones can take its toll on our mental health. Daily meditation for as little as 20 minutes can drastically improve our ability to cope with the recent lifestyle changes we have been forced to undergo. This article on [How to Meditate](https://samharris.org/how-to-meditate/) is enough to get you started. You can also browse r/meditation for more information or FAQ.\n\n**Yoga**\n\nFirst meditation, now *yoga*? What kind of list is this going to be? I know, I know, but hear me out. Adding a simple yoga routine to your day can improve flexibility, prevent injury, improve athletic performance and increase energy. I find doing 10-15 minutes in the morning makes me more alert during the day and 10-15 minutes at night can relax me before bed. Youtube has videos that are sport, time of day and skill-level specific. I recommend starting with [this simple 10 minute beginner flow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaoV1PrYft4). If you find it beneficial, r/yoga is an active and knowledgeable community.\n\n**Bodyweight Exercises**\n\nGetting exercise is crucial to our health and with gyms around the country closed, it's easy to fall out of any good habits we may have been in before the pandemic. Fortunately, you don't need a gym to get a good workout. All it takes is our bodies and maybe some everyday items most of us have in our homes. Why not give [this workout by the GOAT bodybuilder](https://www.reddit.com/user/GovSchwarzenegger/comments/flz3es/stay_at_home_stay_fit/), Arnold Schwarzenegger, a try? If that doesn't do it for you, r/bodyweightfitness has plenty more routines you can choose from.\n\n**Running**\n\nIf cardio gains are more your style, try running in your neighborhood. While stay at home orders recommend only leaving home for necessary supplies, most states specify that it is okay to go outdoors for exercise as long as social distancing guidelines are adhered to. Depending on your starting level of fitness, you can start with r/c25k (Couch to 5k) or [Hal Higdon's Novice 1 Marathon Training Program](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/novice-1-marathon/). I used the latter to run the Los Angeles Marathon in 2018. Check out r/running for more.\n\n**Learn Personal Finance**\n\nThis might not be a sexy hobby, but it's one your future self will be grateful you started now. Everyone knows they should learn personal finance, but all the talk about emergency funds, IRAs, 401Ks, APY, and other terms can be pretty intimidating at first. Fret not, r/personalfinance has a [comprehensive wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index) to get your started. If books are more your style, I recommend [The Index Card](https://www.amazon.com/Index-Card-Personal-Finance-Complicated-ebook/dp/B00W2ZKIOO/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=the+index+card&amp;qid=1586126349&amp;sr=8-1) and [Broke Millennial](https://www.amazon.com/Broke-Millennial-Scraping-Financial-Together-ebook/dp/B01LYN4H34/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=broke+millennial&amp;qid=1586126409&amp;sr=8-2). If you're not a reader (thanks for reading this far), you can get the same information for me through the [Khan Academy's Personal Finance](https://www.khanacademy.org/college-careers-more/personal-finance) series.\n\n**Investing**\n\nInvesting goes hand-in-hand with personal finance, but can also be a lot more of an active activity. It can include investing for the long-term, which you can read about in [The Little Book of Common Sense Investing](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Common-Sense-Investing/dp/1119404509/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1GWF1OKDO88I5&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=the+little+book+of+common+sense+investing&amp;qid=1586126679&amp;sprefix=the+little+book+of%2Caps%2C241&amp;sr=8-2), or you can be a more active investor by trading stocks daily. With fees at an all time low, it has never been cheaper to get started in trading stocks. r/investing and r/stocks are good places to gather more information. You can use my referral code to open a [Robinhood](https://join.robinhood.com/derekr1110) account and get a free stock in the process.\n\n**Chess**\n\nA personal favorite of mine, chess is a rabbit hole with no bottom and with an internet connection, you will never run out of opponents to challenge. Create an account on [Lichess](https://lichess.org/) or [Chess.com](https://Chess.com) and challenge me (@SwoleBuddha) to a game. If you're just starting out, International Master John Bartholomew has a fantastic YouTube series on [Chess Fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl9uuRYQ-6MBwqkmwT42l1fI7Z0bYuwwO) that I guarantee will help you improve your game.\n\n**Learn a Foreign Language**\n\nLet's face it. It's hard not to be impressed by someone who speaks multiple languages. With all this free time indoors, there's never been a better time to join the ranks of the bilingual. Free apps like [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) make it easy to get a basic grasp on many languages, while inexpensive tutors can be found online through sites like [Italki](https://www.italki.com/).\n\n**Gardening**\n\nMaybe you have a sprawling backyard that could use some sprucing up or maybe your only free space is a windowsill in a sunny window. Regardless, gardening is a hobby that anyone can get into during quarantine. As a bonus, you might even get some delicious and healthy fruits, vegetables and spices to eat in a few months. r/gardening has all the information you need to get started in your region.\n\n**Cooking**\n\nEvery single adult should know at least the basics of cooking. Not only will it save you money, it will also make it easier to eat healthy and it can be a fun tradition to pass down to future generations. [Gordon Ramsay's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJy1ajvMU1k) is loaded with instructional videos to help you get going and subreddits like r/cooking, r/eatcheapandhealthy, r/recipes, and r/bachelorchef are some of my favorites for recipes and inspiration.\n\n**Drawing/Painting**\n\nGet in touch with your creative side by picking up drawing or painting as a hobby. All you need to get started is a piece of paper and a pencil, although there are plenty of other tools that are recommended if you want to pursue this hobby. [Bob Ross's The Joy of Painting](https://www.youtube.com/user/BobRossInc) is available for free on YouTube.\n\n**Learn a Musical Instrument**\n\nPlaying an instrument can be a challenge, but it's a challenge well worth undertaking. Whether it's learning your favorite rock songs on a guitar, a classical piece on the piano, a metal song on drums or anything in between, now is the perfect time to begin learning to play an instrument.\n\n**Reading**\n\nIf you don't love reading, you're not reading the right books. If the Steinbeck and Faulkner you were forced to read in high school turned you off of the hobby, try finding books on topics that you are into. Sports? There are books on that. Traveling? That too. Sci-Fi Lesbian romance? There are even books on that. Think of what topics interest you and then ask on r/suggestmeabook for recommendations.\n\n**Coffee Tasting**\n\nIf you're anything like me, the thought of that first cup of coffee is what eventually pulls you out of bed each morning. Make coffee more than just a way to get your daily caffeine fix! Learn the different types of beans, methods of brewing and subtle notes of flavor that gourmet coffee has. [Trade Coffee](https://www.drinktrade.com/onboarding/question/1) even has a quiz to help match you with a coffee that will be sure to liven up your mornings.\n\n**Become an Alcohol Connoisseur**\n\nIf coffee isn't your thing, maybe alcohol is. Your local grocery store will have a wide variety of craft beers, whiskeys, tequilas, vodkas, gins or any other liquor you might be interested in becoming more knowledgeable about. Browse r/whiskey, r/tequila or r/beer for recommendations of product available in your price range.\n\n**Home Brewing**\n\nYou love beer, right? Wouldn't it taste even better if you made it yourself. Homebrewing has gained a ton of popularity over the last decade and homebrews can taste as good or better than the beer from your local brewery. All it takes is a couple hours of work and then the patience to let it ferment for a few weeks. [The Northern Brewer](https://www.northernbrewer.com/collections/beer-brewing-equipment-starter-kits) sells kits for beginners for as low as $57.99.\n\n**Podcasting**\n\nEveryone has an area of expertise. With podcasting, it has never been easier to share your knowledge with others. All you need is a microphone, even the one on your phone will do.\n\n**Puzzles**\n\nA good puzzle can keep your mind occupied for hours. Whether you prefer crosswords, wordsearches, sudoku, jigsaw puzzles or something else, these weeks under quarantine are the perfect time to sit down and put your brain to work.\n\n**Become a Film Buff**\n\nWho was that actor who was in that war movie with Kevin Bacon? Who knows? YOU DO! Because you took advantage of the Covid-19 quarantine to watch classic movies. Even devoting a few hours a week to watching the classics that are available on streaming services will turn you into a movie quoting, 6 Degrees of Kevin Bacon machine! [AMC's 100 Greatest Movies](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls062678943/) can get you started.\n\n**Grilling**\n\nI'll never forger being in my early 20s, on a date in the park with my first real girlfriend. The fresh air, the sound of the birds, and the awkwardness of being a full-grown man who doesn't know how to light a Weber. Learn from my mistakes and watch this [Beginner's Guide to Using a Charcoal Grill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QyJGpYqrVY) video. Then, eat like a king!\n\n**Astronomy**\n\nFor as long as man has roamed the Earth, he has looked up at the stars. Instead of looking to them for answers, we can now look at them for the sake of their own beauty. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/dh496j/new_sticky_draft_voice_your_opinions_in_the/) from r/telescopes can help you purchase the right telescope for your budget. After that, r/astronomy can help you answer any further questions.\n\n**Leathercraft**\n\nWhat's manlier than the smell of fresh leather? Start with the basics and work your way up to making backpacks, wallets or even boots! The wiki in r/leathercrafting can help you order all the [supplies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Leathercraft/wiki/index#wiki_leather_suppliers_.28north_american-based.29) you need to get going.\n\n**Healthy Eating**\n\nSo you took my suggestions above and starting barbecuing various meats and washing them down with your favorite beer or hard liquor, which you are now an expert on. It might be time to focus on your long-term health by adding healthier foods to your diet. A proper diet can leave you with more energy, a sharper mind, less physical ailments and a longer lifespan! Why wouldn't you pick up healthy eating as a hobby? I recommend reading [How Not to Die](https://www.amazon.com/How-Not-Die-Discover-Scientifically/dp/1250066115/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=how+not+to+die&amp;qid=1586146248&amp;sr=8-1) by Dr. Michael Greger to get on the path to longevity through proper nutrition. Subreddits like r/eatcheapandhealthy and r/plantbasediet are also very helpful. Netflix documentaries like The Game Changers and Forks Over Knives are also fantastic.\n\n**Writing**\n\nI believe everybody needs at least 3 hobbies. One to challenge us physically, one to challenge us mentally, and one to challenge the creative part of our brain. As far as creative hobbies go, it's hard to top writing. Hell, I'm doing it right now! Write that novel you've had in the back of your mind, that non-fiction work the world has been waiting for, or simply start a blog on a topic you're interested in. Simply putting your thoughts into a journal is enough to tickle that creative muscle.\n\n**Cocktail Mixing**\n\nYou finally have that long-awaited romantic evening alone with that special someone. As the night winds down, you offer to make a drink for the two of you. It's at this moment that you realize you only know how to make cocktails with 2 ingredients. Mood: Killed. Never let this happen to you by learning the basics of bartending and drink making. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Korztk8bMWs) offers some helpful advice for stocking your first home bar.\n\n**Learn to Code**\n\nI can hear you now. \"SwoleBuddha, all these hobbies are fine, but I want to spend my time learning something that could benefit my career.\" Learn to code! Computer coding is a highly sought after skill by many employers and it can even allow you to do your own freelance work. Get started for free on [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/).\n\n**Learn to be Handy**\n\nYou know that leaky faucet you've been ignoring? How about that squeaky door you've been meaning to fix? Instead of paying a professional to fix these problems, learn how to fix them yourself. Knowing basic handyman skills will save you money and it might just make you more popular around the neighborhood (after the pandemic ends, of course).\n\n**Basic Car Maintenance**\n\nOwning a car can get expensive in a hurry, especially as it gets older. But if you learn to do basic maintenance and routine care, such as oil changes, you can save yourself a lot of money. Simply type in the make, model and year of your car into YouTube and the chances are there will be hundreds of videos explaining how to do almost anything you could want to do to your car.\n\n**Flipping Items**\n\nWe all have things at home we don't need anymore. While you're stuck at home, take some time to sell some of those things on eBay. With so many people avoiding brick-and-mortar shops, now is a great time to sell things you don't want/need online.\n\n**Credit Card Churning**\n\nIn 2016, I spent 3 weeks in Colombia and my only expenses were my meals and entertainment. My flights and hotels were entirely paid for with credit card points. It sounds too good to be true, but I and many other people are taking advantage of credit card points to travel the world. A few days of research is all it takes to get started and r/churning has all of the information you need.\n\n**Genealogy**\n\nI've always been fascinated with my ancestry. Something about knowing how many things had to work out perfectly in order for you to have been born is enough to boggle the mind. Use sites like [Ancestry.com](https://Ancestry.com) to bring the story of your ancestors to life. It can really stir the imagination. \n\n**Magic Tricks**\n\nA good magic trick, properly performed, can leave an audience in disbelief. I'm a firm believer that every man should know at least one good trick, whether it's with a deck of cards, a coin, or some other prop. Use the abundant resources on YouTube to find one that appeals to you. Then practice it until it's perfect. Your friends will be amazed at your first post-pandemic party.\n\n**Free Online Classes**\n\nWith this much free time, everybody should be learning something new. Sites like [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) and [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/?utm_source=gg&amp;utm_medium=sem&amp;utm_content=01-BrandedSearch-US&amp;campaignid=380484307&amp;adgroupid=101900669240&amp;device=c&amp;keyword=online%20learning%20free&amp;matchtype=b&amp;network=g&amp;devicemodel=&amp;adpostion=&amp;creativeid=427090837642&amp;hide_mobile_promo&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwm9D0BRCMARIsAIfvfIbFrJ2JVdMPMwb4zKuawr0ngTT09TVimifrVeSFkx0Mk5qIcZP627oaAizxEALw_wcB) have an abundance of online lectures on myriad topics. Find one that interests you and get to learning!\n\n**Minimalism**\n\nThis one is more of a lifestyle than a hobby. Nonetheless, the time spent in quarantine can be used to get rid of excess items that you no longer need, want or use. What's left are the items that you truly enjoy. Take it from a recent convert to minimalism, a cluttered house equals a cluttered mind, but a clean and organized house full of only important belongings can do wonders for mental clarity and happiness.\n\n**Digital Minimalism**\n\nIn a similar vein, I recently made steps towards living a more minimalistic lifestlye in regards to my digital habits as well. It's a liberating feeling to not have to check your phone every 5 minutes, read the news every morning and night, check social media almost hourly and respond to texts continuously. When we cut out the time we spend on our phones, we leave time to pursue other, more important hobbies. I recommend reading the book [Digital Minimalism](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Minimalism-Choosing-Focused-Noisy/dp/0525536515/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1586822642&amp;sr=8-2) by Cal Newport, but many articles on the subject have been published for free online. \n\n**Upgrade Your Wardrobe**\n\nThink of being quarantined as being in a cocoon. Don't you want to emerge afterwards as a beautiful butterfly? Pardon the lame metaphor. Fashion is ever-changing and if your everyday wardrobe contains white New Balances and dad-jeans, it might be time to head over to r/malefashionadvice and get up to speed on the latest trends. \n\n**Skincare**\n\nSkincare?

Like other kinds of design, fashion thrives on productive tensions between form and function, automation and craftsmanship, standardization and customization, universality and self-expression, and pragmatism and utopian vision. It exists in the service of others, and it can have profound consequences\u2014social, political, cultural, economic, and environmental.\n\nFashion as Design focuses on a selection of more than 70 garments and accessories from around the world, ranging from kente cloth to jeans to 3D-printed dresses. Through these garments, we\u2019re going to look closely at what we wear, why we wear it, how it\u2019s made, and what it means. You\u2019ll hear directly from a range of designers, makers, historians, and others working with clothing every day\u2014and, in some cases, reinventing it for the future.

Feynman technique that got quite a bit of attention; most people hadn't heard about it and some had but did it in different ways. I noticed that there are a lot of people on this sub learning a variety of subjects and need/want help in how to optimize their learning capabilities.\n\nLearning how to learn has literally changed my life in more ways than I can think. I am by no means Einstein, I'm not a genius, and I still have to work hard regardless. But, some of the things that I've learned throughout my journey of figuring out how to acquire new information/knowledge/skills has helped me to learn new things quicker, easier, etc.\n\nBefore we begin, just note that all of us have different strengths, weaknesses, good qualities and bad qualities about ourselves. You should NOT use these techniques to compare yourself to others or use others as a measuring stick for your success. They have nothing to do with you. You should always aim to be better than yesterday and to be the best version of yourself possible.\n\nThis will help you whether you're studying medicine, math, physics, chemistry, history, gardening, cooking, dance, a foreign language, martial arts, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Understanding + Memorizing =&gt; Active Recall**\n\nPeople usually mention to \"understand\" something vs. just memorize. I've found and researched that understanding and memory actually go hand in hand. When you understand something, you're more likely to memorize it, and when you don't initially completely understand something, but you memorize it, if you keep trying to understand it, that initial \"memorizing\" that you've done will help you to understand it anyways. They are a lot more linked than people like to give them credit for. Anyways, both of these things can be emphasized by a means of active recall. Active recall is when you have NOTHING in front of you to guide you to a solution and you're trying to come up with it on your own. For example, you've already read the chapter, or have gone to class, and have \"watched\" the professor discuss section 7.5. Rather than open your notes and rework problems with the solution right in front of you, close your notes and put the solution away. Give it an honest effort to solve the problem. Then, after giving it LOTS of effort, once you get stuck and are like \"meh, this isn't going anywhere,\" check the solution. But, don't only look at it and be like \"ah, I just need to subtract this.\" That's the HOW; which is fine. Know the \"how\". But also try to know the \"why\". Why are they subtracting that number? Why not add it? Doing this is tough, but it helps you understand, and therefore helps you remember. If you want to take this a step further, try what's called the pre-testing effect. First, without any \"first-pass\" knowledge of the material (meaning without going to class or reading or studying) and solely based on your current knowledge of the word, try to tackle a problem. You most likely cannot solve it. Then, review material, then try to actively recall and solve the problem using what we just described above. You'll find that the initial effort will help you make the material stick when you actively recall it a second time better because of all that effort you had already put in. One of many ways to do this is with the Feynman technique that I posted about the other day. Don't obsess over the details of this method, just find out your routine and stick with it. Basically, you work on a problem, material, etc. figure out what you don't know (you investigate what you don't know by finding gaps in your knowledge via writing everything you know about the topic out on a paper or explaining it out loud as if you are engaging a class and you are a teacher teaching the subject). Then, once you identify gaps of understanding, use source material (a textbook, a tutor, Youtube, Google) to find explanations of the information, then go back to the process of writing out the explanation on a paper and/or speaking out loud to your imaginary class and try to explain that newfound knowledge of yours in super simple and easy to understand ways. The easier your explanation, it means the more you have made the concept/idea/information accessible to your mind to digest, and therefore, the better you learn it. Using big words, jargon, etc. is not necessary here. Explain it to a 5-year-old. Explain it to somebody who has no idea what you're talking about. Explain it to a class that has never studied the chapter before. Make it as simple as you possibly can. Always go back and simplify the concept several times. The more the merrier.\n\n2. **Space-time-repetition**\n\nMemories fade. There's no way around it. If you want to remember something, you have to be exposed to it many times. Thus, you have to decide if something is important for you to know for the long-term. If it is, make sure to find a system to see the information periodically so that you will be able to review it and eventually put it into long-term memory. There's software like SuperMemo and Anki that help optimize your review schedule. You can use Anki/SuperMemo for class material, for languages, for ANYTHING, and they are highly customizable. You can use it to memorize a recipe in order of ingredients. You can put images of martial arts moves and ask yourself their names. You are better off making the cards yourself and following this guide to save yourself a lot of headaches and make some good cards: [Effective Learning: 20 Rules of Formulating Knowledge](https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/articles/20rules)\n\n3. **Start early!**\n\nYou are definitely going to have to work on procrastination if it's an issue for you. You are going to have to get more organized and better at scheduling. You don't have to be robotic with it, but you do have to ensure that you have enough time to actually learn the things that you are trying to master. Learning takes time, and a good way to get motivated to fix your procrastination issues is to understand why it's important to have enough time. When you learn, your brain creates new connections and the circuitry of the brain changes. There are two modes: 1) focused and 2) diffuse when you are in focus-mode, you're concentrating on something (like a problem), etc. When you're in the diffuse-mode you're not focusing anymore and you can be doing anything else (like showering, like going for a walk, chatting with your friends/family) but your brain subconsciously is trying to solve the riddle/problem/etc. that you were focusing on when you were. So, the constant switching between focus and diffuse modes is absolutely essential to you developing these new chunks and connections. The ultimate diffuse mode is sleep; good quality sleep will help you recall information and develop chunks better. This is why it's important to start things in advance, the more time you have, the more times you are able to switch between focus and diffuse modes of learning. If you wait until the last minute or cram, you are hindering this process and aren't allowing this to happen.\n\n4. **Variety**\n\nThe brain likes novelty. Depending on the subject, this may be hard to do, but do your best to change the input or the ways the brain receives information. A perfect example is if you're learning French. Let's say you're always reading. Well, that's good, keep it up. But also try perhaps listening to an audio of the text that you are reading. Then read the text. Then listen and read simultaneously. Then write what you are listening to. Then read aloud the text. Then read aloud + listen + write the text. Ask yourself questions about the text. Write what it made you think about, feel, your opinions, how you would communicate it's theme to others, etc. Engage your brain. Use as many senses as possible. With math problems, use real-world examples, book examples, make belief examples, outrageous examples, anything to help make the abstract become more tangible.\n\n5. **Have fun!**\n\nLife is tough as is it, no need to be miserable and grind yourself to the bone. Make sure to have fun, to make your learning fun, and to enjoy your life outside of your studies. Hit the gym, go for a run, walk a train, watch a movie, read a book, hang out with friends/family, do crossword puzzles, do anything that you enjoy!\n\nResources that you can use to further understand the process of learning how to learn effectively:\n\n* [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)\n* [A Mind for Numbers](https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Numbers-Science-Flunked-Algebra-ebook/dp/B00G3L19ZU)\n* [Make it Stick](https://www.amazon.com/Make-Stick-Science-Successful-Learning/dp/0674729013)\n* [Mastery](https://www.amazon.com/Mastery-Keys-Success-Long-Term-Fulfillment/dp/0452267560)\n* [Your Memory: How it Works and How to Improve It](https://www.amazon.com/Your-Memory-How-Works-Improve-ebook/dp/B00D0UZZFW/ref=pd_sbsd_14_4/131-8814507-4484222?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=B00D0UZZFW&amp;pd_rd_r=9c1636f7-4a33-4246-a8ff-629e959db47d&amp;pd_rd_w=qwXxr&amp;pd_rd_wg=RPxq1&amp;pf_rd_p=19c1c1b6-5915-41d4-a7b6-21d99360350b&amp;pf_rd_r=3SQVBM6Y8AWVC3NWGSP8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=3SQVBM6Y8AWVC3NWGSP8)\n* [How to Become a Straight-A](https://www.amazon.com/How-Become-Straight-Student-Unconventional-ebook/dp/B000MAHBYQ)[ Student](https://www.amazon.com/How-Become-Straight-Student-Unconventional-ebook/dp/B000MAHBYQ)\n* [Deep Work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692)\n* [Active Recall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL0QFTwgEgQ)\n* [Study for a Test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTl97fyXyT4)\n* [Study 30 Minutes a Day, Get a 4.0 GPA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppvVsSQa9gc)\n\nI hope this helps!
