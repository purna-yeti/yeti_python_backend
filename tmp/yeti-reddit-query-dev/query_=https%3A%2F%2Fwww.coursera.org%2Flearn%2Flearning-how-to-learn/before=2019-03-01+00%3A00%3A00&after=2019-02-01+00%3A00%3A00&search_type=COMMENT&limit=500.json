That aside though, what it sounds like you're really interested in is learning different valuation methods. There are a bunch of different methods for valuing companies, and probably the most straightforward and easiest to begin with would be discounted cash flow analysis.\n\nFor this kind of analysis and other valuation methods I'd recommend the /r/SecurityAnalysis  sub, which is much more focused on valuation and arriving at a fair price for the security vs this and the other investing subs which are aimed more at simply \"how to read financial statements\" and \"help me find a hot stock pick\"\n\nOf course, you need to know the basics of reading financial statements in order to value a company in the /r/SecurityAnalysis sense, but just being able to read an income statement, balance sheet, or cash flow statement can be learned with about 10 minutes of googling (e.g. \"how to read a balance sheet\", \"what is operating cash flow\", \"how to read an income statement\", etc) and then you can head off to learn valuation methods. The real concern though is that financial statements are easily manipulated by management who attempt to skirt the rules and push the envelope with aggressive/unethical accounting tactics in order to meet wall street earnings expectations. Learning to read financial statements to identify accounting tricks is much more involved and more of an art form than a science, though there *are* some scientific methods you can use to decide if there is a high probability of manipulation. For that, a good place to start might be this free course: https://www.coursera.org/lecture/accounting-analytics/module-overview-earnings-management-2-0-W2Zg6 \n\nThe entire accounting analytics course above is really good, so if you have the time/dedication/interest I'd highly recommend it, but at the very least once you know how to read a basic financial statement and do a DCF analysis to arrive at a price, the first step before doing the DCF analysis should be to verify the integrity/quality of the financial statements you'll use in your analysis by using tactics in the course here. The goal would be to first make sure that the financials aren't being manipulated, and then perform your analysis. \n\nHope this helps!", "created_utc": 1551366867, "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "ehh8en0", "link_id": "t3_avdore", "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_ehh27q8", "permalink": "/r/StockMarket/comments/avdore/what_resources_do_you_use/ehh8en0/", "retrieved_on": 1551366868, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "StockMarket", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjuv", "created": 1551366867.0}, {"author": "sch77", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_emb5y", "author_patreon_flair": false, "body": "Maybe you just need to step outside.

Mathematical thinking is not the same as doing mathematics \u2013 at least not as mathematics is typically presented in our school system. School math typically focuses on learning procedures to solve highly stereotyped problems. Professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself. The key to success in school math is to learn to think inside-the-box. In contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box \u2013 a valuable ability in today\u2019s world.

Studying an hour a day beats studying 7 hours on Sunday in terms of memory retention as well. And if you have a big project or paper to write, it's much easier to write out a draft early, get feedback from a professor, writing center, or other resource, and then iterate on the project or paper than it is to try to do the work at the last minute.\n* At the beginning of the semester, put all of your syllabi into a master calendar with different colors for your different classes. That way you can see which weeks are going to be intense and which are going to be easier so you can work ahead in one or both classes.  \n* Use Anki or another spaced repetition program to memorize specific things.\n* Take good notes in class and review them for the first time that day. You can use any technique that you like, the studies that showed that people remembered better when writing on paper than typing on a computer have been updated with the caveat that this difference disappears when people have done a session of review. \n* Check out the free coursera course \"Learning how to Learn\" https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn\n* I also liked an old book called \"What smart students know\" Here's a slide summary of that book: https://slideplayer.com/slide/5331101/\n* Take care of your physical health: exercise, eat well, sleep enough.\n* Don't miss a day of class: the first class you skip in a semester makes it easier to miss subsequent classes.

I stopped missing classes once I figured out that an hour of class cost more than 3-4 hours of pay working my minimum wage job. \n* Build time into your schedule for hanging out, playing video games, drinking, etc. But make sure you do your studies first. \n* If you treat school like a 30-40-hour a week job you will have plenty of time to study, go to class, do the readings and assignments, get enough sleep, exercise, and still have a bit of time to hang out and do the typical college stuff. If you try to just go to classes and that's it, you're going to have a bad time. \n\nThere are also tons of specific mnemonic techniques that are workable but they have more specific applications.

Europe only has one country listed in the top 10 by region, but it is slowly catching up with a higher number of searches on AI in Ireland, Denmark, Sweden and the U.K. The sub-field of machine learning / artificial intelligence has increasingly gained popularity mostly because of the \"big players\" in the market, but the open source machine learning framework that has seem to got everyone's attention is TensorFlow - which just recently grew over 1000 contributors.\n\nTensorFlow\u2122 is an open source software library for high performance numerical computation.\n\nNow let's talk a bit about how you can get access to relevant information on the Machine Learning &amp; Artificial Intelligence\u200a topics.\n\nObviously, the best way to start would be to sign up to a technical university that has programs discussing. This way you would have access to lecturers with experience and you'd be able to clear out things directly with the professor. But if you're already past that time in your life, here is where you can start:\n\n**1. Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach** \\- a book by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig - which covers all of the major topics. The book is an \"up-to-date introduction to the theory and practice of artificial intelligence\".\n\n**2.** [**Intro to Machine Learning**](https://eu.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120) **- Pattern Recognition for Fun and Profit** \\- a Udacity course where you'll have as instructors two experienced leads: Katie Malone and Sebastian Thrun.The course if free (at least at the time of writing this article) and should take approximately 10 weeks to complete it. \"This is a class that will teach you the end-to-end process of investigating data through a machine learning lens.\"\n\n**3.** [**Machine Learning**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning#%20) \\- taught by Andrew Ng (Adjunct Professor, Stanford University) - is an 11 weeks course which will take you from linear regression with one variable to large ccale machine mearning.This is probably one of the most complete guides into Machine Learning currently available online.\n\n**4.** [**Machine Learning A-Z\u2122: Hands-On Python &amp; R In Data Science**](https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/) (Kirill Eremenko, Hadelin de Ponteves) is available on Udemy. This course will help you learn how to build robust Machine Learning models, make accurate predictions or know which Machine Learning model to choose for each type of problem.\n\nOf course, if you're searching for a free course for beginners, because you're not sure the topic will catch your interest on the long run, you can also have a look over these [Free A.I. Resources from Google](https://www.yes-dublin.com/free-a-i-resources-from-google/).\n\nIf you don't have a technical background and don't really want to tackle a steep learning curve in the domain of Artificial Intelligence, but still would like to develop a project, you always have the option of getting in touch with a [software development company](https://infobest.ro/what-we-do/software-development/) that has specialized personnel to help you at all stages of your project, starting from consultancy and design and ending with deployment.\n\nHave you tried out any of the resources above or have other courses and books you'd like to share?

It really helps knowing other programmers or being a part of a community that can help you out. Which is why I think people pay for bootcamps over doing things themselves. It'll provide you with the structure and environment for learning. \n\n \n\n I've mentioned this in this sub before, majority of the self taught / bootcamp grads take a Jr job for less than market rate pay for 1 - 2 years and then they move up to better positions once they've proven they can be a developer.\n\nThere are always the ones who land a job at Google after bootcamp or studying, those (from what I've seen) have a STEM degree of some sort. A lot of times it's an engineering degree like EE or ME.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf web development is where your interest is, I recommend taking a course on web development on your own time. Build some CRUD applications, test it out first.

All things you do consciously take effort. Automated tasks you do subconsciously and take a lot less mental effort. So create your own routine, e.g:\n\n* Each weekday I wake up at 7:00 have some breakfast, have a run, shower whatever, and head for the library to arrive at 9:00\n* Then I do 4 rounds of studying or go to a class.\n* Lunch\n* 2 rounds of studying\n* half an hour break\n* 2 rounds of studying\n\nDoing this well means you need to tweak your own reward mechanisms. Remove wrong intcentives from your study environment (internet, games) Celebrate your improvement. Even if you only do half a round at first then you have improved compared to yesterday! Fallback is to be expected at some point: pick yourself up and try a set a goal you can realize well. Don't expect to change everything in a day, because nobody has the discipline to study all they, they have routine as well!

Don't sweat being scared. We're scared of the unknown. You're empowering yourself with knowledge.\n2. Philosophy is about nerdy intangible shit. It's not physically validated making it all theories until it is proved or disproved with future studies limited by technological advancement. \n3. Stigma = Fear. Fear \u2260 Knowledge. \n4. Boundaries are important. Try to find out from his family or someone who has seen him, what kind of boundaries he requires before dropping in. Everyone is different, some people want the company and support. (Some are introverts.) Also, be conscious of your boundaries with him. \n\nIt's okay to be scared. I struggled a lot with it, especially since my family has a history of schizophrenia. But it creates an opportunity for us to learn more and grow as a person. A way to challenge this fear is to inform yourself. We are essentially afraid of the unknown, a situation where we don't understand the situation. \n\nMental health is studied in Psychology. Psychology is a sect in Philosophy. Philosophy is the study of the intangible. We can observe emotions, but we can't consistently measure them clinically. Our understanding of the intangible is limited by our science and technology. This means we are perpetually learning more and evolving dependent on current or future studies and resources available.\n\nStigma is perpetuated by fear, which generally originates from a time when we didn't have the knowledge or resources we have today. The reptilian part of our brain is responsible for triggering one or more of the four f's of survival (feast, fight, flee, or fornicate) when we're placed in a situation which scares us. This is due to our adrenal system which kept us alive prior to dominating the food chain. It's also what gives people the strength to lift buses and shit whenever they see people in danger. \n\nStigma from a mental health consumer's perspective can be crippling. I used to facilitate recovery groups for people with mood disorders. It surprised me how many people limit their own personality by using a diagnosis for their identity. It's easy to do considering we were still performing lobatomies in mental health institutions as late as the 1970's. I'm really lucky to have known about Coursera when it was free. I did this course, and it opened my eyes to different aspects of mental health.\n\nhttps://www.coursera.org/learn/mental-health\n\nI think you can join and do one class free. That one would be worth the investment. \n\nWe also have a special part of our brain that can be used to trigger more empathetic responses to unknown situations. With our knowledge in neural plasticity, we can find ways to create habits that decrease the potential to trigger our reptilian centre.\n\nBe scared. Own that shit, but don't let that fear define you or your beliefs. You're a smart guy, you're doing awesome by asking for more information. \n\nWhen talking about unhealthy behavior think about the difference between enabling and supporting. If you're friend is experiencing psychosis but uses psychoactive drugs or refuses to take their medication (cuts cold turkey), make strong boundaries. Addiction is often comorbid with mental health concerns, and it can create caustic situations. \n\nIf you really want to support your friend, try to think about how you would feel in his situation. How would you want him to treat you if roles were reversed? Make sure those ideas wouldn't trigger him and go nuts. People just want to be treated like before when we have mental health symptoms flare. It's confusing and feels really shameful due to all of the preconceived notions of mental health. (Stigma sucks)\n\nI have never been hospitalized for any mental health concerns. I have been clinically diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, but am high functioning. I don't wear my symptoms on my sleeve. I have a professional background in mental health. I have a warm, friendly, and inviting demeanor and create quick rapports with people. I experience psychosis because of the trauma endured in childhood. I was a SUPER sensitive kid. Cried at everything. And slowly I decided to stop reacting and start empowering myself. I've done courses, read multiple books, have years of volunteer experience with a crisis line that supports sexual assault/abuse survivors. \n\nSuper cool side story: one of my best friends has been diagnosed with high functioning schizophrenia among other ailments. He is unmedicated due to other ailments, but is able to consistently confirm what is realistic and what is delusional. Hands down smartest guy I know. He's going for his doctorate in Metaphysical Sciences and is constantly helping me with my thesis in the same field. Psychosis is a life changing thing, but it doesn't mean things are \"done\". :)\n\n\n", "created_utc": 1549106842, "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "efl3l1s", "link_id": "t3_alusaz", "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_efia41n", "permalink": "/r/Psychosis/comments/alusaz/what_is_psychosis/efl3l1s/", "retrieved_on": 1549106842, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Psychosis", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tyg2", "created": 1549106842.0}, {"author": "Jampak_5000", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_zp23f1j", "author_patreon_flair": false, "body": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn\n\nits here, Barbara Oakley and some others. suggest you do the entire course, do the optional assignments, and read the reference materials that interest you. \n\nThe final coursework, is to make some kind of presentation summary.
