Your majors and ESPECIALLY your prior experience doing actual research in a biology lab will go a long way in your PhD program application; make sure to emphasize you've worked in a lab before in your letter, resume, and any interviews/etc. A math degree like yours is particularly well-suited for comp neuro work, since it's the only real subject that you have to learn serially (up to a point). The GPA could be an issue, but probably only at really competitive programs. I don't know how they score the GRE anymore, but just make sure your quantitative score is high.\n\nYou didn't say what area of comp neuro research you were interested in, so I'll give my spiel delineating it. You can separate comp neuro into really two categories: computational modeling aka simulation, and data analysis.\n\nThe first, neural simulation, gets a lot of press but is actually a pretty small portion of neuro research as a whole; fortunately it is slowly becoming more popular (see http://www.opensourcebrain.org/ ) and better integrated with modelers and experimentalists working together. This can be big supercomputer stuff, but most simulation is done on a lab's beefy desktop computer or a university's shared computing cluster. Make no buts about it, this job is 95% sitting in front of a computer, either programming, double-checking your model is implemented into the code correctly (i.e. making sure a parenthesis isn't out of place!!!), reading literature, and theorizing. It can be an isolating grad school experience, for better or worse. If you like programming and are detail-oriented, you'll be good here. To be frank, however, there's no part of science where being detail-oriented isn't important. Also, two points of confusion: \"neural networks\" and \"statistical modeling\" (see next para). Simulation for neuroscience uses \"neural networks\" which are the same IN PRINCIPLE as neural networks used for machine learning / artificial intelligence etc., BUT both the details of the models themselves and the philosophy are different. Your neural simulations can have much more biological detail encoded into them than neural networks meant for ML/AI, because the goal of comp neuro is to understand the brain by understanding the network itself and how it performs some phenomenon (science), while ML/AI use neural networks to perform some kind of processing for a specific use like a Netflix movie recommendations (engineering). ML/AI is a much, much bigger field than comp neuro, so the average thing you see mention \"neural networks\" on the internet will usually be about the former.\n\nThe second, data analysis, can be further split into two categories: performing analysis on real data using typical techniques, and developing new analysis techniques, usually statistical, spectral/signal-based, network-based, or some combination. The former is what every experimentalist also has to do, and in the private sector is called \"data science\"; this is cleaning the data (because there's always something weird about it), visualizing it, learning from it, choosing and applying different statistical models to understand the data, etc. This is work most grad students will have to do, and it's good to get experience with real-life, \"dirty\" data. This will not be the only thing you work on, with the exception of students who do fMRI/large-scale imaging research. As for developing new analysis techniques, a keyword that indicates a lab specializes in this will often be \"statistical modeling\". Focusing on that for your research will be like being an applied mathematician, where most of your work is developing and exploring new mathematical techniques, while also testing/using them on real data, often in collaboration with an experimental lab. Note that \"statistical modeling\" and \"computational/neural modeling\" sound very similar, and indeed they all use computers, but \"statistical modeling\" is almost always developing new analysis techniques for real data, while \"computational/neural/biophysical modeling\" are instead the keywords used for neural simulation like mentioned in the previous paragraph, where you're, so to speak, \"performing experiments\" in the computer to try to understand some specific neural question or phenomenon.\n\nI delineate these to help you understand how to read a university research lab's self-description of its research, since finding a lab that researches 1. neural phenomena you're interested in using 2. techniques you would like to perform is important. The choice of advisor/lab you think you would like to join is almost certainly more important than the program, since the majority of your time in PhD grad school will NOT be taking classes, but rather performing research in that advisor's lab. It is common to also work on projects that collaborate between two advisors at the same school, or even at different institutions. The critical thing is to apply to schools that have multiple people you think you would be interested for (in their labs), as this will be asked during the application process. You're not married to those choices, though, and in the course of doing your initial classwork over the first few years you may get interested in a completely different research direction than you initially thought - that's common and good! I came in convinced I was going to work on experimental brain-machine interfaces, but eventually switched to biophysical modeling of anesthesia.\n\nI know this is long, but maybe the most important piece of advice is to try to get an understanding of a potential advisor's personality -- if you find a lab you're particularly interested in, don't just reach out to the professor who's the head of the lab, but ALSO ask what working in the lab is like to the grad students and postdocs specifically. The professor may be really nice to your face, but scientists are people too and may have strong personalities, good or bad, like being unreasonable tyrants to their grad students (since once you've spent a few years in someone's lab, you're typically in it for the \"long haul\" and it's super difficult to change projects and labs if your advisor turns out to be tyrannical) or becoming . Also ask if the lab head lets students/postdocs mostly do their own thing (common of older professors) or is very hands-on and more likely to work alongside you (common of younger professors); make sure those align with how you prefer to work.\n\nAfter PhD school: most professors (who have been tenured for a while) and grad school programs will not be forthcoming or aware about how rare it actually is for you to eventually become a xtenure-track professor, if that's what you want. Nature has published a lot on how the proportion of \"life science PhDs who obtain a tenure-track position within 10 years of finishing their degree\" is about 15%. In other words, the vast majority of people who finish their PhD in the life sciences will never become traditional professors who run their own labs. Getting a PhD used to be a direct path to starting a professorship at another university many years ago, and any career path other than that is often still termed an \"alternative path\" by grad programs, but the truth is that MOST PhDs will do something else: teach and not do research at a smaller university, work in industry like pharmaceuticals, work in government or NPOs and review grants, work at a research institute, etc. And say what you will about unethical pharma companies, but there's really not that many places that have the resources to develop new drugs that really do help people, and get them approved by the government.\n\nFinally, I think others have posted some, but here's several free online courses useful for comp neuro:\n\n- https://www.edx.org/course/neuronal-dynamics\n- https://www.edx.org/course/computational-neuroscience-neuronal-dynamics-of-co\n- https://www.coursera.org/learn/computational-neuroscience\n- https://www.edx.org/course/simulation-neuroscience\n- https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/brain-and-cognitive-sciences/\n\nFeel free to message me if you have specific questions, and good luck!", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1604074514, "gildings": {}, "id": "gam2bav", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_jkjynu", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_jkjynu", "permalink": "/r/compmathneuro/comments/jkjynu/recommendations_for_phd_hopeful/gam2bav/", "retrieved_on": 1604075573, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "compmathneuro", "subreddit_id": "t5_2saow", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1604074514.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "travelguy23", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_7ceo1eys", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "And here is a course about just that... https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1604064402, "gildings": {}, "id": "galiyly", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_jkrf5d", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_gakvf2d", "permalink": "/r/Entrepreneur/comments/jkrf5d/anything_i_can_use_to_learn_a_skill_for_free/galiyly/", "retrieved_on": 1604064413, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qldo", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1604064402.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "acitta", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_457dc", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "[Science Literacy](https://www.ualberta.ca/admissions-programs/online-courses/science-literacy.html)\n\n About the Course\n\nWe are often told not to believe everything we read online or see on  TV\u2014but how do we tell the difference between sensationalized statistics  and a real scientific study?

Don't attempt the hard ones initially, do the easy ones to get a feel for programming. Don't be discouraged if you cannot do it initially -- it requires learning, patience and practice.\n* Then pick up basic c++ or java, and write solutions to the same problems (that you already wrote in python).\n* After you solve about 10-20 problems, you're ready to take an algorithms course. [https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms#courses](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms#courses) is a good course for this.

It's definitely a good place to start though.\n\nThere are also some good free online courses for getting started with guitar. For example, the Berklee \"Guitar for Beginners\" on Cousera:\n\nhttps://www.coursera.org/learn/guitar\n\nI'd also suggest at least a couple of face to face lessons (or Skype/Zoom lessons) with a professional guitar tutor. It's best to get some of the basics (how to hold the guitar and how/where to place your fingers) face to face so you make sure you're not doing something that could cause long term problems.\n\nAlso there's no real way around practice. Getting those chord shapes down, getting those scales right... Fortunately that's why Rocksmith has the Guitarcade mini games - you can practice these \"boring\" things, but it's dressed up as a game, so you don't feel like you're just repeating some boring exercise.\n\nI do recommend still trying to get familiar with a few practice/warmup exercises. There are lots of videos online with great exercises and tips. John Petrucci's \"Rock Discipline\" is a great example - a bit more advanced, but the warmup stuff is also good for beginners, and there are some other useful tips in there. Another great intermediate exercise is the \"spider\" exercise. I think you should probably only try doing these exercises (beyond the warmup) after you feel comfortable with the basics.\n\nThe most important thing is to make sure you're not hurting yourself or causing any damage. Your fingertips will absolutely hurt as you build up your callouses. But anything beyond that is a sign to take a break. You might get some muscle cramps - don't try to power through them. It's OK to take breaks.\n\nThe second most important thing is to try to focus on music that you enjoy and that's fun to play, otherwise it's easy to lose motivation. Try to have fun and remember why you're playing. I remember the first 2-3 weeks were a struggle, trying to get my fingers to move into the chord shapes, all while my fingertips hurt. You basically need to power through the first couple of weeks of practice.\n\nTry to keep practicing regularly. This is something I still struggle with myself - and I'm definitely a bit rusty, and not as good as I was... Learn from my mistakes and don't step away from the guitar for a few years (Rocksmith actually helped me get back into it a bit).\n\nOnce you feel a bit more confident with the guitar - the best thing is to play with others. Having a gig coming up (or even just a rehearsal) is a great motivator to keep practicing a song over and over until you nail it. Also it's a great opportunity to learn from the others - what techniques are they using, what exercises, and how do they play parts that you find tricky? Maybe they play something differently. Remember - playing with other guitarists isn't a competition, it's a learning opportunity.\n\nI'd say there are 2 \"dangers\" when playing with others. 1 is feeling demotivated and \"I'll never be as good as them\". The feeling is understandable - but also nonsense. If you keep practicing you'll get there. The 2nd danger is developing \"GAS\" - Gear Acquisition Syndrome. Seeing other guitarists with their cool expensive guitars and pedals can lead to you spending lots of money on gear you don't necessarily need. I'm just coming out of a couple of years of severe GAS - and while I enjoy the gear I bought - it doesn't make me a better player. If you find yourself watching gear reviews more often than picking up the guitar (which I've done for a while) try to stop yourself and force yourself to pick up the guitar instead.

It's much like a person learns their first language as a child. They may not be able to recite or explain the rules, but they will intuitively know what does and doesn't sound \"correct\" in their language by the time they begin formal education.  \n\nIf a person learns to play an instrument (or sing), then they will probably become *musically literate* by learning *musical notation*, which is how music is written and read. It's like learning how to read and write in their language. Some people learn to play or sing *by ear*, without ever becoming musically literate.\n\nMusic theory is a deeper level of understanding. It's like studying a language academically.  You can probably intuitively understand a lot of musical \"grammar\",  but music theory teaches you how and why music sounds the way that it does. You learn the *fundamentals* of music and how they work in a meaningful way.\n\nSome of the things you may learn in the study of music theory are:\n\n* Musical Notation \n* Melody, Harmony, and Rhythm\n* Consonance and Dissonance\n* Scales and Modes\n* Chords and Chord Progression\n* Musical Form/Structure\n* Musical Analysis \n* Sight-Reading \n* Ear-Training\n\nIn an academic setting, courses in Music Theory - including Sight-Singing, Ear-Training and Musical Analysis as either integrated or separate courses - are generally part of a comprehensive musical curriculum including other musical studies such as Music History, Music Technology, Music Performance, Music Composition, etc. Most of these subjects complement and provide valuable context or synergy with each other.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nIf you want to begin learning music theory, I would suggest first learning the basics of **musical notation**, if you haven't already. There are a ton of websites that teach music notation as well as music theory. Here are a few.\n\n* [Theory Lessons](https://www.musictheory.net/lessons) (Start with \"The Basics\" to learn Notation.)\n* [Basic Music Theory Made Easy](https://www.music-theory-for-musicians.com/basic-music-theory.html) (Start with the **Alphabet** section if you are an absolute beginner.)\n* [The Basics of Reading Music](http://readsheetmusic.info/readingmusic.shtml)\n\n\nA **piano/keyboard** (or even a guitar) is extremely useful for studying notation and music theory, because you can use it to visualize and play notes, *chords*, or anything else you are learning about. \n\nThere are **virtual pianos** you can use instead, on your computer/tablet/phone through websites or apps. They won't teach you play a *real* piano, but they will give you a useful visual of what you are studying. \n\n* [Online Pianist - Virtual Piano Keyboard](https://www.onlinepianist.com/virtual-piano) (Toggle both Keyboard and Letter Notes for ease of learning.)\n\nYou can take **free university courses** in music theory online. There are a plethora of really great lessons in music (and many other subjects) available online now. They run the gamut from blogs and YouTube tutorials all the way to actual Ivy League courses! Many universities are now offering selective course content online for *anyone* to learn through \"Massive Open Online Courses\" at sites like [edX](https://www.edx.org/) and [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).\n\nHere are a some courses to get you started. Some are for true beginners, while others may require some basic skill or knowledge in music.\n\n* [Introduction to Classical Music](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introclassicalmusic) (Yale)\n* [Getting Started With Music Theory](https://www.coursera.org/learn/music-theory) (Michigan State University)\n* [Fundamentals of Music Theory](https://www.coursera.org/learn/edinburgh-music-theory) (University of Edinburgh)\n* [Introduction To Music Theory](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-music-theory-2) (Berklee College of Music) \n* [Approaching Music Theory: Melodic Forms and Simple Harmony](https://www.coursera.org/learn/melodic-forms-simple-harmony) (CalArts)\n\n\nIf you learn best from reading, it can be helpful to purchase textbooks and supplemental workbooks, if you can afford them. Don't be afraid to buy older editions! Older editions of textbooks are generally much cheaper, and the basics of classical music theory haven't really changed in a while. Newer editions are generally not a necessity in a subject like music. It's just a way for textbook publishers to milk more money out of college students.\n\nYou'll want to get *staff paper* at some point, for musical notation and theory exercises. (It's also called \"manuscript paper\" or even \"blank sheet music\".) There are plenty of sites that let you download &amp; print free staff paper, or you can purchase notebooks of it. You can also use music notation software, but if you're still learning music notation it may feel unnecessarily complicated at first.\n\nUseful Tools:\n\n* [MusicTheory.net Tools](https://www.musictheory.net/tools/) (Calculators, utilities, and a staff paper generator.)\n* [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/en) (Free and powerful music notation software.)", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1602817213, "edited": 1602817401.0, "gildings": {}, "id": "g8yt9l7", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_jbryhg", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_g8xuy0m", "permalink": "/r/menwritingwomen/comments/jbryhg/well_that_was_some_refreshing_introspection/g8yt9l7/", "retrieved_on": 1602820126, "score": 2, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "menwritingwomen", "subreddit_id": "t5_3ox0h", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1602817213.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "glxyds", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": "compsci", "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "3b507574-fca3-11e3-9244-12313d187c89", "author_flair_text": "Computer Science", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_q9255", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Hi there!\n\nExams are definitely tough on most people so you're not alone there.

It's easy to let things like sleep, exercise, and diet go to the wayside when you are stressed or studying. Don't! Sleeping well, moving your body (even if just for a walk), and eating help your brain remember things and helps you focus.\n5. You shouldn't get down on yourself. It's not a matter of being bright or not. Everyone learns in their own way, maybe you just haven't discovered yours yet! Online learning is definitely tough too.\n6. Separating yourself from your parents' thoughts might be useful here. They love you and they always will. You need to do school and work hard for YOU, not for them. That is what will make them proud and make their investment in your education worth it.\n\nHopefully some of this helps! If you want to talk about any of it I'm more than happy to do that.

Only you and make those decisions--meaning if it fits your needs and helps you understand.\n\nHowever, good quality instruction from highly qualified instructors usually comes from college, universities, and online learning platforms. Here are a few I would recommend. Some free, some paid, most of them are good resources to get you going (for example, edX has courses from MIT, Harvard, and Berkley).\n\n* [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com)\n* [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com)\n* [Linda.com](https://Linda.com)\n* [Kahn Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming)\n* [edX](https://learntocodewith.me/edx)\n* [Learn Programming Online](https://learnprogramming.online/)\n* [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)\n* [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org)\n* [hackr.io](https://hackr.io/)\n* [One Month](https://onemonth.com/)\n* [Learn Python](https://www.learnpython.org)\n* [MIT Open Courseware](https://ocw.mit.edu)\n* [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com)\n* [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com/)\n* [Upskill](https://upskillcourses.com/)\n* [BitDegree](http://bitdegree.org/learn/)\n* [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/)\n* [scotch.io](https://school.scotch.io/)\n\nHere are a few articles you could read about learning programming:\n\n[https://lifehacker.com/top-10-ways-to-teach-yourself-to-code-1684250889](https://lifehacker.com/top-10-ways-to-teach-yourself-to-code-1684250889)\n\n[https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-learn-programming/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-learn-programming/)\n\n[https://hackr.io/blog/how-to-learn-programming](https://hackr.io/blog/how-to-learn-programming)\n\nTo wrap things up, I'll just say that when I look at resumes to hire a programmer I'm not as interested in what school she attended or what degree he might have as I am in what they have done--what can you show me?\n\nThe other things that are important to me are: \n\n* Can you tell me about your code? What did you do? What was difficult and how did you solve those problems? Why did you make the choices you made? \n* Where have you failed and what did you learn?\n* Do you love writing code and creating digital stuff?\n* Are you driven to learn and solve problems? \n* Can you take constructive feedback and not let it destroy you?\n\nKeep learning and writing code.

So, they started learning Spanish together and raised their 3 children bilingual (only spoke Spanish at home, we are in USA so the kids learned English easily outside the home).

Allora per iniziare, ti dico di prendertela con calma con l'uso di Anki. Ha una sua curva di apprendimento, quindi sicuramente non \u00e8 un programma facile da usare, soprattutto perch\u00e8 \u00e8 un medium non intuitivo e MOLTO creativo, quindi tutte le persone hanno i loro approcci per usare gli Spaced-Repetition Software in generale.\n\nDetto questo, ci sono dei principali aspetti da imparare per sfruttare il pieno potenziale di Anki: a) Anki, b) Le scienze cognitive dell'apprendimento, e c) HTML, CSS, Python e JavaScript (opzionali ma consigliati). \n\na) Ti consiglio di imparare di Anki, inizia dalla seguente guida: [https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/](https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/).\n\nb) Allo stesso tempo, quello che vuoi fare \u00e8 applicare le scienze cognitive dell'apprendimento. Purtroppo sul subreddit di Anki \u00e8 pieno di persone che non hanno conoscenze a riguardo. Quindi ti consiglierei di informarti per conto tuo su questi argomenti. Molte volte \u00e8 pi\u00f9 facile cercare consigli sul subreddit rispetto alla letteratura scientifica, ma ci\u00f2 che \u00e8 facile alcune volte non corrisponde alla qualit\u00e0. Detto questo ti consiglio studiare le seguenti fonti (almeno i consigli pratici): [https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn), [https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Numbers-Science-Flunked-Algebra-ebook/dp/B00G3L19ZU](https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Numbers-Science-Flunked-Algebra-ebook/dp/B00G3L19ZU), [https://www.amazon.it/Make-Stick-Science-Successful-Learning/dp/0674729013](https://www.amazon.it/Make-Stick-Science-Successful-Learning/dp/0674729013), [https://www.amazon.com/Peak-Secrets-New-Science-Expertise-ebook/dp/B011H56MKS](https://www.amazon.com/Peak-Secrets-New-Science-Expertise-ebook/dp/B011H56MKS), [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1529100612453266](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1529100612453266), [https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition](https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition), [https://www.retrievalpractice.org/](https://www.retrievalpractice.org/) e infine [https://www.learningscientists.org/](https://www.learningscientists.org/).

Le domande aperte servono per testare le tue conoscenze in stile top-down. Es. Domanda: Parlami dell'evoluzione secondo Darwin; Risposta: etc. Le domande a risposta breve servono per testare le tue conoscenze in stile bottom e bottom-up. Es. Domanda: Formula di struttura della lisina; Risposta: etc. o Domanda: In che anno \u00e8 nato George Washington? ; Risposta: 1732. Le domande a risposta breve le userei per fatti o concetti difficili da ricordare (o i tuoi punti di debolezza). Quindi ti consiglierei di crearti le domande a risposta breve su pezzi di informazione che non hai richiamato (o hai sbagliato) durante le revisioni delle domande a risposta aperta. Per le domande a risposta breve, ti consiglio di studiare questa guida: [https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/articles/20rules](https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/articles/20rules); ma prendi con le pinze ci\u00f2 che dice, secondo lui l'approccio ideale \u00e8 quello atomistico, ma secondo me (e anche secondo la scienza) l'approccio ideale \u00e8 puntare all'equilibrio tra l'approccio olistico e quello atomistico. In questo modo hai sia il big-picture che il little-picture.   Purtroppo sul subreddit di Anki molti usano solo l'approccio atomistico. Anche io ci ero cascato inizialmente ma bisogna stare attenti alle fonti e domandarsi sempre chi \u00e8 l'autore, il suo contesto intellettuale, il contenuto scritto, etc. Studiare da pi\u00f9 fonti (scientifiche) \u00e8 pi\u00f9 difficile e meno gratificante ma \u00e8 l'approccio pi\u00f9 qualitativo, obiettivo e gratificante a lungo termine.\n\nc) Ti consiglio di imparare i linguaggi di programmazione sopraelencati. Imparando CSS ad es. puoi ''standardizzare'' la creazione delle domande a risposta breve. Ovvero, ti crei dei template da usare come base delle carte per poi riempire i campi (fields) che differiscono. Con Python puoi creare degli addons che hanno come funzione di risolvere dei problemi o debolezze di Anki con l'aggiunta di funzionalit\u00e0 aggiuntive. Insomma, per migliorare il tuo user experience, i linguaggi di programmazione sono i tuoi migliori alleati. Imparandoli, acquisisci pure delle skills che sono richieste dal mercato e rendi anche i tuoi processi pi\u00f9 efficienti. \n\nInfatti, alla fine Anki serve per risparmiare tempo sullo studio e ''gamificarlo'', ovviamente queste variabili dipendono da come lo usi. La scienza e l'autosperimentazione fanno parte delle ''chiavi'' per queste variabili.\n\nPer ulteriori dubbi: [https://sites.google.com/view/ankitaly/homepage?authuser=0](https://sites.google.com/view/ankitaly/homepage?authuser=0); il nostro canale discord: [https://discord.com/invite/jXDtF6Y](https://discord.com/invite/jXDtF6Y)", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1601809444, "gildings": {}, "id": "g7nute5", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_j419he", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_j419he", "permalink": "/r/Ankitaly/comments/j419he/aiuto_per_iniziare/g7nute5/", "retrieved_on": 1601809455, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Ankitaly", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ab3cr", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1601809444.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "createanewaccountuse", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_hl9up", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Yup, can't retain anything either.

The framework (using a GAN) I was going to go with is based on [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/aifortrading-2edd6fac689d#b21b), which I found super insightful. There seem to be problems with it based on the comments people have left so I'm not sure the results would hold up, but, even if that's the case, it still covers a bunch of topics that come into play when trying to build a ML model for trading.\n\nI'd definitely be down for a chat! This weekend wouldn't be great for me, but maybe we can plan for next weekend? As for collaborating, I'd be happy to share ideas and strategies. I understand why people tend to be protective of that stuff, but, honestly, I feel like the pool is so big it wouldn't make a difference unless everyone started doing the same thing lol. I'm actually using this as an excuse to learn machine learning, so I'd prefer to work on the code part separately. Still, the interesting/tricky stuff is in what strategy and ML approach to use, so there's a lot that can be gleaned from sharing there.\n\nI'm not 100% sure how I'm going to approach cashing out. Right now, I think setting some sort of stop loss is the most sane way to go about it. What I'm less sure about is how to go about determining those stop loss values. Could be interesting to apply ML to that too...\n\nAlso, I'm reconsidering using a GAN.
