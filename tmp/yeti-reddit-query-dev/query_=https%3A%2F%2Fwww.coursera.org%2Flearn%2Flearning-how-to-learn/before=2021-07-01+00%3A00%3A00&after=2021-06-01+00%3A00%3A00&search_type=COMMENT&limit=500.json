I don't understand how they sit for so long and wonder how much they really learn in 12 hours.\n\nIt sounds like you are actually doing everything right. I'll refer you to [this free course on how to learn through Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn?) which I've done and it's fantastic.\n\nHere is what I recommend though:\n\n* Researchers find that those who are able to recall items better don't just use the hippocampus (which rote memorizations places a heavy emphasis on) and instead use the frontal cortex as well. This suggests deeper processing and recall is related to executive functioning. In other words, THINKING about what you are learning, not just forcing it into your brain.\n* To think about a topic means relating it to information you already know and are familiar with: thinking, \"how does this relate? Why is it important? What is the context for this?\" (which sounds like you are already doing!) The process of building on previous knowledge is known as Scaffolding.\n* After you have thought about your topic and have related it to information you already know use the Feynman Technique to really master it. Do this by pretending to give a talk on your subject to an audience (or if you can find someone who will listen, even better!).\n* When doing the Feynman Technique, give a talk and refer to your notes or book only when you can't remember. Keep giving the talk, trying to use less and less of your notes or looking back in the book each time. The goal is to give a whole presentation without referring to anything but your own knowledge on the subject.\n* Researchers also find that visual learning is more effective than auditory learning. See if you can find charts and graphs, use visual metaphors for abstract concepts, or visualize a word problem or real-world practical application for a math problem. When studying the brain I like to draw the brain and see where I am reading about (I like to know exactly where the Substantia Nigra is and draw those dopaminergic pathways)\n* Sometimes it's hard to really remember big complicated lists. Chunk them into smaller categories of 7-9 items. For instance, there are a great number of symptoms for Schizophrenia that are all hard to remember. But I can chunk the symptoms into Positive, Negative, and Disorganization categories. Each category has 4-6 symptoms in each so all I have to do is 'unpack' the chunk.\n* You can also Chunk large papers by breaking it down into points, themes, or headings (whichever makes sense for that paper) then summarizing the information in a paragraph or two. The paragraph you create may allude to other concepts which you just need to unpack.\n* Another memory technique is the Memory Palace (Method of Loci) in which you visualize a space you are very familiar with (like your bedroom) and connect items you need to remember with things in the room. (See [Elaborative Encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaborative_encoding) for more info and similar techniques)\n* I use flashcards a lot too. Not for large complicated subjects but the little details and definitions. I use [Brainscape](https://www.brainscape.com). Research shows that you can't really read something once and expect to retain it long term. You need to strengthen the connections related to recall so that you can recall it on demand easier. To do this you need to revisit the subject periodically and refresh those connections. Flash cards help you do this through the concept of 'spaced repetition' and apps like what I use give you the option to rate how well you know something so that it comes up more often if you don't know it well and less often if you do.\n\nOk, so that's a lot. \n\nLet's do a small recap:\n\nTake a topic and think about it's relationship to everything else you are learning. Pair new information to information you already know. \n\nGive a presentation to an imaginary audience on the subject, referring to notes less and less. If you have to keep referring back to notes then try to chunk the concepts into something smaller and more manageable or you can draw the concept out, find a visual reference, make a memory palace, or try another elaborative encoding technique to help recall it. \n\nLastly, revisit the concepts periodically by re-giving your fake presentation or using a spaced repetition flashcard app to remember small details and definitions.\n\nHope that helps, and good luck!", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1624458577, "gildings": {}, "id": "h2rs04m", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_o6573u", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_o6573u", "permalink": "/r/IWantToLearn/comments/o6573u/iwtl_how_to_internalize_information_knowledge/h2rs04m/", "retrieved_on": 1624750313, "score": 3, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1624458577.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "deadpuppy23", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ccsdeym", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "There is a free course by Barbara Oakley:\n\n[https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1624242615, "gildings": {}, "id": "h2hugi5", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_o49x5w", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_o49x5w", "permalink": "/r/books/comments/o49x5w/how_to_retain_what_you_read_from_books_nonfiction/h2hugi5/", "retrieved_on": 1624551103, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "books", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh4i", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1624242615.0}, {"all_awardings": [{"award_sub_type": "GLOBAL", "award_type": "global", "awardings_required_to_grant_benefits": null, "coin_price": 100, "coin_reward": 0, "count": 1, "days_of_drip_extension": 0, "days_of_premium": 0, "description": "Shows the Silver Award... and that's it.", "end_date": null, "giver_coin_reward": null, "icon_format": null, "icon_height": 512, "icon_url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_512.png", "icon_width": 512, "id": "gid_1", "is_enabled": true, "is_new": false, "name": "Silver", "penny_donate": null, "penny_price": null, "resized_icons": [{"height": 16, "url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_16.png", "width": 16}, {"height": 32, "url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_32.png", "width": 32}, {"height": 48, "url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_48.png", "width": 48}, {"height": 64, "url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_64.png", "width": 64}, {"height": 128, "url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_128.png", "width": 128}], "resized_static_icons": [{"height": 16, "url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_16.png", "width": 16}, {"height": 32, "url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_32.png", "width": 32}, {"height": 48, "url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_48.png", "width": 48}, {"height": 64, "url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_64.png", "width": 64}, {"height": 128, "url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_128.png", "width": 128}], "start_date": null, "static_icon_height": 512, "static_icon_url": "https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_512.png", "static_icon_width": 512, "subreddit_coin_reward": 0, "subreddit_id": null, "tiers_by_required_awardings": null}], "associated_award": null, "author": "Onihikage", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_agi05", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "The key is to use any given site as a tool to supplement other parts of your life, rather than being the thing you spend your life on. Pick and choose what you're exposed to whenever possible.\n\nSocial media is a powerful tool to stay in contact with people you care about, but you have to restrict it to that purpose. Ignore the feeds entirely, and only look at DMs with the people you know and want to stay in contact with. You'll only learn what's going on with people's lives if you talk to or message them, and that's the point. Relationships are supposed to require some degree of effort to maintain; ignoring the feeds prevents you from just passively keeping up with the lives of far more people than you otherwise would if you had to actually talk to each one. As a result, you'll put effort into the ones who matter the most to you, and those relationships will be much more fulfilling.\n\nFor video streaming, search for and subscribe to channels or sites that have clearly put effort into the quality of their content, and it's content which expands your horizons and deepens your understanding of the world on some level, whether that's science, history, engineering, art, etc. Never click a recommended video; rather, if you see something that interests you in the recommendations, search for that subject, and avoid results that seem meant primarily for entertainment or sensationalism. If your household has a cable TV subscription, you might have complimentary access to [CuriosityStream](https://curiositystream.com/), which has a more educational direction than YouTube's front page or trending (never visit YouTube's trending page, it's not worth it).\n\nThere's online fiction available all over, both paid and free, whether translated from other languages or being actively written by native (or non-native) speakers. [RoyalRoad](https://www.royalroad.com/home), [ScribbleHub](https://www.scribblehub.com/), [WuxiaWorld](https://www.wuxiaworld.com/), and even a few subreddits here like /r/redditserials. Some of it's poor quality, as everyone has to start somewhere, but some of it is absolutely professional grade. Find something you enjoy and read it to exercise your imagination - but remember that variety is the spice of life. You can also check out e-books from your local library through apps like [Libby](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby/), if you have a [library card](https://youtu.be/lyxEDSnegTU). This is great for nonfiction!\n\nThere are educational sites you can use to dip your toes into something you may have been exposed to elsewhere, or expand a little on something you already understand. [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org) and [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) are two big ones, and many universities have open courses such as MITOpenCourseware, Stanford Online, Harvard Extension, Open Yale Courses, etc. There's also free language learning out there if, in the course of reading translated fiction, you want to take a deeper look at the original language and the culture it came from.\n\nAnd of course, there's the research side of things, which I'm sure you already know about. Stuck on a video game? Find a wiki or walkthrough to help you understand what you're missing. Have an appliance stop working? Throw the model number into a web search to see if there's a way to fix it, or if it has a service manual somewhere like [ManualsLib](https://www.manualslib.com/). Knocked a hole in your wall by accident? Look up how to patch it yourself. Learn to change the oil on your car, if you're lucky enough to have one. The intelligence of the whole rest of the world is at your fingertips!\n\nThe hardest thing on the internet to find is something you didn't even know to look for.

Your brain is supposed to forget stuff; imagine how overwhelming it would be to remember the number of ceiling tiles in every room you ever entered, how many freckles were on the left cheek of your second grade teacher. A big part of learning is just convincing your brain of what is and isn't important.\n\nWhen you re-engage with content, whether that's going out of your way to review it or needing to use it for a task you are doing, you give your brain a nudge and say it's important. Eventually (hopefully) you'll be reading books in Japanese and a lot of that review will happen naturally, a byproduct of you entertaining yourself, but until that point you've got to grease the wheels yourself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Any tips\n\nJust some things that I recommend to beginners, in general:\n\n* [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn): A free Coursera course on what science has discovered about learning, and how you can use optimize your own learning\n* [Zipf's Law](https://luckytoilet.wordpress.com/2017/07/12/the-power-law-distribution-and-the-harsh-reality-of-language-learning/), [The 50% Rule](https://drawabox.com/lesson/0/2/50percent), [How to Learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2N5a7XZWg8), [Music School](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acSeROJZZCc)\n* [Remember It!](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G446SG2/) by Nelson Dellis, a 4x memory champion, on how memory works and how to remember everything from passwords to words in a foreign language (he's learning Dutch).
