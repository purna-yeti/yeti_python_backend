Obviously full credit goes to the man/woman, the myth, the legend that is sydGAMSAT.***\n\nHello, hello you beautiful and brilliant people. In response to the influx of posts asking for tips / guidance on S3 prep, I\u2019ve decided to post my starter list of *free* GAMSAT resources. This is intended to provide you with a range of resources to pick what\u2019s right for you. You don\u2019t have to do everything on this list (and shouldn\u2019t), but hopefully some of these are helpful.\n\nFirst up though, let\u2019s make one thing clear: **there is no such thing as a perfect resource**. The type of understanding required for the GAMSAT is deep and nuanced. Anyone who tells you that \u201cX is all you need\u201d is lying, and probably trying to sell you X. Far more important that the list of resources which follows is knowing how to use them effectively. In this regard, I offer three broad tips.\n\n1. All learning *must* be active. You only learn to the extent that you engage with the material. Sitting through a Khan Academy video with one hand down your pants and the other playing internet poker is 100% worthless (from a learning perspective, at least!). Take extensive notes, pause the video and attempt to solve the example problem before Sal does, then work through his solution in comparison to your own and identify differences in approach and thought process. Make no mistake, you will not be testing on your ability to recall information, but on your ability to apply it. So practice applying it.\n2. Multiple sources should be the rule. There will be exceptions, but in general, you need to use multiple resources on the same topic in order to understand it to a \u2018GAMSAT level\u2019. This is not because individual resources are not comprehensive enough. It\u2019s because the type of understanding required cannot come from a single perspective. You need to view the same topic from multiple angles and perspectives, in order to develop a truly \u2018three dimensional\u2019 understanding of the material. I would recommend an initial video / lecture / introductory resource, a well written textbook, and some sort of advanced textbook or online resource.\n3. Do not concern yourself with memorisation of values or facts, but take extreme care to ensure that you understand the underlying source of those values or facts. One of the most important tools in scientific reasoning is a clear understanding of *determinism*. So many GAMSAT questions test your understanding of this. Another way to say it would be that you need to understand the *direction* of the formulas. F = ma isn\u2019t enough, because too often I see students trying to tell me that forces are produced whenever objects accelerate!\n\nThese are broad tips, and they are neither sufficient nor comprehensive when it comes to developing a high quality GAMSAT preparation plan. However, they\u2019re broad enough that in my estimation, they\u2019re relevant for the majority of students. That said, you can\u2019t rely on what any one person says (myself included!), and so there\u2019s one, final, golden rule.\n\n**Develop your own learning plan!** At the end of the day, nobody can tell you how to learn, or what the optimal strategy is. There are things that work better than others but everyone is different and everyone experiences learning differently. You need to reflect on your techniques, your approaches, your styles, etc and find what works for you.\n\nSo, here\u2019s a basic starter list of resources. It\u2019s not comprehensive. Nothing is. If you\u2019ve got something you want added, drop a comment and I\u2019ll throw it in. Free stuff only, though =)\n\n**General Coursework**\n\n[Khan Academy](https://web.archive.org/web/20200721061205/https://www.khanacademy.org/science/) \\- Everyone knows it. Khan Academy is a great resource to supplement and reinforce your learning. It is not enough on its own, and attempting to use it as such will lead to lack of success. One thing that Khan does offer is a relatively comprehensive list of topics. If you study everything on Khan\u2019s list, then reinforce with additional resources, it\u2019s highly unlikely that you\u2019ll be lacking a significant amount of knowledge. Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Physics, Biology, etc are all good.\n\n[Coursera](https://web.archive.org/web/20200721061205/https://www.coursera.org/) \\- Countless online courses, all free. Varying quality and relevance to the GAMSAT, but there\u2019s a lot here. A lot of the material is highly specialised and doesn\u2019t offer a good, introductory overview. However it\u2019s a great chance to refine your knowledge and explore higher level applications of basic knowledge.\n\n[MIT Opencourseware](https://web.archive.org/web/20200721061205/https://www.youtube.com/user/MIT) \\- MIT opencourseware is an amazing collection of lectures from MIT. Huge range of stuff, incredibly well taught. Very maths and comp-sci heavy, but there\u2019s plenty of physical science in there too, and even biology! This is what I would consider to be the absolute gold standard for GAMSAT prep. Force yourself to engage with advanced content. The GAMSAT is not easy. If GAMSAT prep is easy, then you\u2019re doing something wrong.\n\n**Physics Videos**\n\n[Prof Dave](https://web.archive.org/web/20200721061205/https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0cd_-e49hZpWLH3UIwoWRA/featured) \\- Professor Dave Explains is a randomly assorted but decent basic set of intro videos to Physics. Use as a supplement to other learning.\n\n[Hewitt Drew-It](https://web.archive.org/web/20200721061205/http://www.conceptualphysics.com/hewitt-drew-it.html) \\- Good visual series of physics videos, and the topic list corresponds relatively well to what's often tested on the GAMSAT. Really great supplement, or even main source of learning if you enjoy the style!\n\n[/r/Thermodynamics](https://web.archive.org/web/20200721061205/https://www.reddit.com/r/Thermodynamics/wiki/video) \\- Amazing reddit resource! Incredible list of thermodynamics videos. Most are probably beyond what will be directly assessed in the GAMSAT, but thermodynamics is one of the hardest subjects to learn (IMO), and these resources give you a myriad of information and perspectives to help develop your understanding of this amazing and complex topic!\n\n[Walter Lewin](https://web.archive.org/web/20200721061205/https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyQSN7X0ro203puVhQsmCj9qhlFQ-As8e) \\- A special mention for Walter Lewin\u2019s lectures. Whatever you feel about the man, he\u2019s a phenomenal educator and his ability to meld concepts with physical demonstrations is unique. This course is not comprehensive -- it doesn\u2019t cover circuits / electromagnetics or light / waves. You\u2019ll need to check out 8.02 and 8.03 for that. However, GAMSAT tends to test classical mechanics far more extensively than the latter two subject areas. If you want to nail GAMSAT physics, then these are probably the single best resource for developing a comprehensive understanding of the material.\n\n**Physics Websites**\n\n[Physics Classroom](https://web.archive.org/web/20200721061205/http://www.physicsclassroom.com/) is a great resource. I love it. Text-heavy and lots of questions but good strong focus on the theory and doesn't cut corners. Not comprehensive -- it doesn't cover torque which can be big, but I 100% recommend learning every topic it offers. This is my #1 recommendation for starting to learn physics. If you can\u2019t handle the text based nature then that\u2019s even better, because the GAMSAT is text based and this is good practice.\n\n[Hyperphysics](https://web.archive.org/web/20200721061205/http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hframe.html) this website is pretty old but Newton invented Physics in like 1800 and it hasn't changed much since then. The topics it covers are often way more advanced than you need to know but it's a good, high-level resource for shoring up your knowledge on the basics too. I would recommend using this as a reference whenever possible (it\u2019s where I go when I want to check a concept) as it tends to discuss physics at a slightly higher level. Aim to leave the entry level rules of thumb and explanations behind asap.\n\n**Chem Videos**\n\n[MIT 5.111](https://web.archive.org/web/20200721061205/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYeYhXUeEE&amp;list=PLUl4u3cNGP63LOmB3_O0xbgZVZibxj4rb) \\- Great intro course for chemistry. Highly recommend starting here and using the resources below if you're struggling with this.\n\n[MIT 51A](https://web.archive.org/web/20200721061205/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do_5_IwSu8U&amp;list=PL6539BAED55972D64&amp;index=1) \\- This is the Organic Chemistry equivalent of the above course. Goes into a lot of detail, probably more than you \"need\", but more is *always* better. If you've got the time and want to get good at OChem, start here!\n\n[Organic Chemistry Tutor](https://web.archive.org/web/20200721061205/https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEWpbFLzoYGPfuWUMFPSaoA) \\- This guy's got thousands of videos, and not just short ones, but like hour+ long episodes. Insane amount of content. I can't speak too much about its quality personally but it's an amazingly broad resource. Not just OChem stuff, but that's where the meat is.\n\n[Tyler Dewitt](https://web.archive.org/web/20200721061205/https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj3EXpr5v35g3peVWnVLoew) \\- Tyler DeWitt is really good for beginners, very very fundamental approach. Aim to move beyond this level asap though.\n\n[Leah4sci](https://web.archive.org/web/20200721061205/http://leah4sci.com/) \\- Leah's got a bunch of great resources on OChem, and is a phenomenal teacher. Use to supplement your learning, not as an indication of scope.\n\n**Chem Websites**\n\n[Master OChem](https://web.archive.org/web/20200721061205/https://www.masterorganicchemistry.com/organic-1/) \\- This is a really great site and has some amazing resources. It's done in blog-post style though which can be tricky to navigate, and some posts are better than others. Still, for organic chemistry some of their summary diagrams and sheets are very useful.\n\n[USyd](https://web.archive.org/web/20200721061205/https://scilearn.sydney.edu.au/fychemistry/) \\- Great resource run by the University of Sydney. Loads of first year chemistry info, including links to useful tools and websites. Lecture notes are unfortunately restricted to students only, but there\u2019s a load of worksheets and huge number of past exam papers with worked solutions. Problem is a lot of the links are dead. [Sem1 exams](https://web.archive.org/web/20200721061205/https://scilearn.sydney.edu.au/fychemistry/Pastexams/chem1101.shtml), [Sem 2 exams](https://web.archive.org/web/20200721061205/https://scilearn.sydney.edu.au/fychemistry/Pastexams/chem1102.shtml), [Sem1 weekly resources](https://web.archive.org/web/20200721061205/https://scilearn.sydney.edu.au/fychemistry/chem1101/resources.shtml?week=1w), [Sem2 weekly resources](https://web.archive.org/web/20200721061205/https://scilearn.sydney.edu.au/fychemistry/chem1102/resources.shtml?week=1w). For the last two, navigate week-to-week in the bottom right corner. Open the \u2018Lecture Notes, Tutorial Worksheets &amp; Answers and Suggested Exam Questions\u2019 drop-down to access some high quality worksheets and homework question sheets (answers typically available the following week).\n\n**Biology**\n\nI haven\u2019t found good resources yet for Biol, but aim to cover the following areas: basic eukaryote and prokaryote cellular physiology including simple molecular biology and biochemistry (DNA, proteins, nutrition / energy), basic human systems physiology (neuromuscular, cardiovascular / respiratory / circulatory, digestive, renal, endocrine, immune), cellular basis of sexual reproduction and genetics.\n\n[Coursera's Introductory Human Physiology](https://web.archive.org/web/20200721061205/https://www.coursera.org/learn/physiology/home/welcome) \\- This is a pretty intensive course, but is a really amazing starting point for developing a strong understanding of human physiology, which is far and away the most valuable part of biology to work on (in my opinion!).\n\n**S2**\n\n[Random Quote Generator](https://web.archive.org/web/20200721061205/http://www.ellipsoid.org/gmi/random-quote-generator) is great for generating a quick set of quotes to write essays on!\n\n**Learning strategies / tools / approaches**\n\n[Pomodoro](https://web.archive.org/web/20200721061205/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) \\- Basically just time-blocking. I recommend doing tasks in intensive 20-25 minute sessions. Exception is essay writing where of course you want to do two, back to back, in 60 minutes for maximum verisimilitude.\n\n[Feynman Technique](https://web.archive.org/web/20200721061205/https://collegeinfogeek.com/feynman-technique/) \\- Phenomenal, and really worth applying. The key to success is highly detailed and complete knowledge.\n\n**Textbooks**\n\nSeparate category at the end cause they\u2019re not technically \u2018free\u2019, but they *are* available at libraries! I get asked all the time, \u201cwhat\u2019s the best textbook for me to use?\u201d. There isn\u2019t one. Use textbooks that interest you. The key is not to learn a defined set of content to regurgitate later, the key is to develop the ability to learn from detailed texts and complex images.\n\nUniversity libraries are filled with these, especially outside semester. Anyone can come along, grab one off a shelf, read it and then put it back (on a trolley though, don\u2019t put it back on the shelf). You can also use your local library, your state library if you\u2019re in a capital city, etc. There are so many freely available books out there -- take advantage of that! Talk to librarians, they seriously love to help.\n\n**Sample Study Plan**\n\nLet\u2019s finish with this really simple, basic study plan. Example only, but designed as a generic \u201cI\u2019m starting fresh\u201d cookie cutter template.\n\n**Mon** 1 hour (2x essays), 1 hour (physics classroom), 1 hour (physics classroom practice Qs)\n\n**Wed** 1 hour (chem video lectures), 1 hour (USyd chem / textbook practice Qs), 1 hour (2x essays)\n\n**Sat** 1 hour (biol video lectures), 1 hour (biol textbook Qs), 1 hour (philosophy / politics / psychology reading &amp; note-taking), break, 1 hour (chem lectures / Qs), 1 hour (physics classroom / videos / Qs), 1 hour (biol textbook / lectures / Qs)\n\n\\~12 hours per week. I\u2019d aim to make that the minimum, though be wary of trying to fit more than \\~25-30 hours of learning into a week, and try to avoid doing too many days back-to-back if possible. Again, this is super generic.

Great starting point if you're a beginner.\n\n[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) for various finance courses from different universities\n\n[Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/), which also has an investments simulator!\n\nI am not a financial expert. I am, in fact, just getting started myself in a lot of ways. (Oy, to have bought Tesla last March! I wept tears of blood.) So I'd like to lay out some basic steps and then open the floor.\n\n1. Budget. However much money you make, it's always good to have a budget. Two of the most common budgeting apps/programs I see are [You Need a Budget](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) and [Mint](https://mint.intuit.com/). Tracking your financials and earning, spending, and saving responsibly are HV behaviors.\n\n2. Earn. Careers will be a whole other post, so I'll be brief here. Value your work and expect to be compensated for it accordingly. Keep an eye on the market rate for your job and skill set, as well as on how much your peers are making. Multiple streams of income are ideal, and I think the most common streams are something like: pay/salary, investments, real estate, side hustle.\n\n3. Save. In my opinion, there are three parts to this.\n\n* Emergency Fund. Conventional wisdom says there should be six months worth of expenses in this fund. Like if you quit/get fired unexpectedly tomorrow, you should be able to live relatively comfortably for at least six months. I personally think a year would be safer, but then people start coming at me about my money just sitting there not doing anything.\n* Fuck Off Fund. You should always have enough money to be able to immediately bail out of a bad situation. Bullying/Sexual harassment at work? Report it, quit, or both, you can afford it. Living with a man who waits until the lease is signed to show his ass? Move out into a new place even if you have to break a lease, because you can afford it. Stranded somewhere? Call that $200 Uber/buy that last-minute flight, you can afford it.\n* Retirement. You should always have a retirement fund going. Whether that's through work with matching or on your own with a Roth IRA, you should always be putting some money in it at least every month. Let that compounding interest work for you.\n\n4. Investments. \n\n(1) Have a retirement fund, per above.\n\n(2) If you're new to investments, it's okay to ease into it. Research and choose a brokerage according to your needs. (Example: Really hands on and not afraid of a steep learning curve? Ameritrade. (Robinhood if you're slumming.) Want to make some choices and just leave it while you learn? Charles Schwab.) Read the fine print for what fees you will have to pay.\n\n(3) Don't be afraid to buy certificates or to look into high yield savings accounts. For example, if you bank with Navy Federal, they have an EasyStart certificate with a 3.5% APY, though the maximum you can deposit is $3000 and it's only for one year. If you're a beginner, this can be an easy and very safe way to dip your toe in.\n\n(4) Stocks. This is a whole other post, and I don't know if I'm knowledgeable enough to really get into it. Anyone?\n\n5. YOUR FINANCES ARE YOURS. Oh my God, if I read one more story about a woman who has, advertently or inadvertently, comingled her finances with a partner she's not married to and/or somehow made herself dependent on them. No judgement, because I've done that too, but GIRL, NO.\n\n* If you're married to them, that's one thing. But if you are not, DO NOT make a partner your primary income, your insurance, your means of transportation, or your landlord. Even if you are, you MUST have financial resources of your own, whether that's a savings account just for you or an emergency fund or whatever. And your name MUST also be on things like leases, deeds, and titles. But not debt. Do not put your name on debt that is not yours, though if you're married and the debt is incurred during the marriage... (IANAL.)\n* If you're with a partner long enough (and don't want to get married, valid choice), then your finances will naturally intertwine. Usually. But *do not* make yourself financially dependent on them.\n* This is verging on FDS territory, but! Watch how a partner deals with finances, both their own and yours. A HVW neither allows herself to be taken advantage of nor takes advantage of others. You can love someone with no money just like you can love someone with lots of money, but you are no one's sugary metaphor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo here's what I want to do in 2021.\n\n* Savings. I'm actually well ahead of myself here because I've been saving aggressively for years, but now I have a big chunk of cash that's not doing anything. I want to do something with it, leading me to:\n* Investments. For the sake of my neuroses, I've eased into this with certificates and a mostly hands-off portfolio, and now I'm trying to get into trading. This is hella stressing me out. I'm seriously considering just hiring a financial advisor.\n* Retirement. Shit, I forgot to adjust my percentages.\n* Philanthropy. I donated off and on last year, but this year I want to do it regularly. I should probably make a budget or something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLADIES, what canny decisions are you making this year?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "FemaleLevelUpStrategy", "subreddit_id": "t5_2c0k6s", "subreddit_subscribers": 16039, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "FLS: 2021. 7 January, Finance", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleLevelUpStrategy/comments/kse2p6/fls_2021_7_january_finance/", "whitelist_status": "some_ads", "wls": 7, "created": 1610028909.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Bibliographies_Admin", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_7r136664", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1610011324, "domain": "self.BibliographiesArchive", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BibliographiesArchive/comments/ks9ssc/singlevariable_calculus/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ks9ssc", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/BibliographiesArchive/comments/ks9ssc/singlevariable_calculus/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1610011335, "score": 1, "selftext": "Calculus is a set of mathematical techniques based on applying the idea of limit to functions, which makes it possible to study the rate at which a function changes at one specific instant rather than just its average rate of change over a finite period of time.  The techniques of calculus are the foundation of physical science, and so it is no coincidence that calculus and modern physics were born simultaneously through the work of Sir Isaac Newton and his contemporaries.\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n\nReaders who wish to learn elementary calculus must have an understanding of arithmetic and basic algebra (manipulating algebraic expressions and solving algebraic equations).  It is helpful but not necessary to be familiar with trigonometry (sine, cosine, and tangent as ratios within the unit circle and their application to geometry) and analytic geometry (parabolas, hyperbolas, conic sections, and other related functions) - these can be learned while studying the calculus.\n\nIt is important to note that *learning this topic is not nearly as difficult as its \"scary\" reputation might suggest*.  Do not be put off by the word \"calculus\" - all readers who have a good grasp of basic math and basic algebra will be able to learn its techniques.  Understanding the ideas behind the techniques will require you to solve many problems, think about the concepts,  and eventually study theorems, but anyone can learn calculus itself.  Readers should think of elementary calculus as being merely the basic grammar of science. \n\n**Where to Start:**\n\nReaders who wish to study calculus should pick a good introductory textbook and work through it chapter-by-chapter.  These books tend to be very expensive, so readers may wish to choose a cheaper, older edition for self-study.  It is very important to solve as many problems given in each section as possible - this is not just to test your reading; working (and sometimes struggling) with these problems is a necessary part of gaining proficiency in the techniques of calculus.  Success will come with practice, and practice means solving problems.\n\nAt the end of a study of elementary calculus, readers should understand functions, limits, continuity, derivatives, and integrals, and should also be familiar with trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions as well as sequences and series.  This will prepare the reader to go on to study the mathematical laws of the physical sciences.  Readers who wish to learn mathematics in more depth may wish to study analysis next, which covers the theorems and proofs behind calculus in far more depth.  However, this will require an understanding of basic logic and the techniques needed to constructing proofs.\n\nReaders who wish to study the physical sciences or engineering will discover that elementary calculus is only the first set of techniques they must master - the next steps are to learn multivariable calculus and differential equations.  Multivariable calculus extends the techniques of calculus to functions of many variables (for example, one can find the volume of a geometric shape by integrating over the interior of the three-dimensional figure).  This should culminate in a study of calculus applied to vector spaces, also known as vector calculus.  In the study of differential equations, readers will learn how to find functions that solve equations containing derivatives - and most of the universe's rules are written in the form of differential equations.\n\n**Books:**\n\n* [Kleppner, Daniel and Ramsey, Norman. **Quick Calculus: A Self-Teaching Guide**.

We highly recommend working as part of a team; you're more likely to succeed, and you'll have more fun with friends.\n\n* Start small. When making your first robot, follow a guide to build something that someone else has already done. Keep it as simple as possible. Once you succeed, *then* you can expand and make it better.\n\n* Do your research.

The great thing about the FLL is you're guaranteed to create a robot that will work in some capacity, and you'll have a lot of fun doing it. One of the best things about the FLL is a lot of the skills you develop can't be taught in a classroom, such as teamwork, organisation, self-motivation, presentation skills etc.\n\n####Robotics Development Kits\n\n* The [Lego Mindstorms kit](http://www.lego.com/en-gb/mindstorms) is a kit of motors, sensors, and a programmable control unit, costing around $400 dollars. Compatible with all of the worlds lego, and a variety of third party electronics, it allows for endless construction possibilities, and will last for years.\n\n* [Makeblock](http://www.makeblock.com/) offer Arduino based robotics kits, at a decent price. With a bit of help from a parent, this can be a great first step into the world of robotics.\n\n\n* A School club is a great for meeting people with a similar passion. If a club already exists, join it. If not, talk to your teacher about the idea of starting one.\n\n\n\n##For teenagers aged 12 to 18\n\n\n####Competitions\n\n* The [First Lego League](http://www.firstlegoleague.org/) (FLL) is an international robotics competition, for teams kids aged 8-14. Autonomous robots built from the lego mindstroms kit have to complete a variety of tasks.

Teams build robots that are both remote control and autonomous, to compete in a 4x4m arena, against 3 other robots.\n\n* The [VEX](http://www.vexrobotics.com/vexedr/competition/) competition, similar to the FTC.\n\n* [BEST](http://www.bestinc.org/) US based competition, similar to FTC/VEX, but allows robots to be made from anything, reducing the costs.\n\n* [EuroBot](http://www.eurobot.org/) European based competition, similar to BEST.\n\n* [Student Robotics](https://www.studentrobotics.org/) (SR) is a UK based competition, designed for sixth form students (16-18). Teams are loaned electronics kits, to build autonomous robots, programmed using python. Has advantages over the FIRST competitions due to being very cheap, but arguably doesn't encourage the development of as wide a range of skills.\n\n* The [FIRST Robotics Challenge](http://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) (FRC).  Under strict rules, limited resources, and an intense six-week time limit, teams of 20 or more students are challenged to raise funds, design a team \"brand,\" hone teamwork skills, and build and program industrial-size robots to play a difficult field game against like-minded competitors. It\u2019s as close to real-world engineering as a student can get. Very cool, VERY expensive.\n\n####Robotics Development Kits\n\n* The [Lego Mindstorms kit](http://www.lego.com/en-gb/mindstorms) is a kit of motors, sensors, and a programmable control unit, costing around $400 dollars. Compatible with all of the worlds lego, and a variety of third party electronics, it allows for endless construction possibilities, and will last for years.\n\n* [Robot C](http://www.robotc.net/) is a $50 a year programming licence, that can be used to program VEX, Mindstorms, TETRIX, &amp; Arduino kits using the C language. Great for taking your existing kit to the next level.\n\n* [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) The Arduino microcontrollers is very easy to program in C, and is ideal for controlling electronics, servos, and sensors.\n\n* [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) is a single board computer, and is great for robotics projects that require more computing power than an Arduino, such as computer vision, of graphical interfaces.\n\n[^This ^Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vhvnaWUZjE) ^(explains the difference between an Arduino and a Raspberry Pi.)\n\n\n\n##For adults over 18\n\n####Competitions\n\n* [FIRA](http://www.fira.net/main/) The Federation of International Robot-soccer Association, has a variety of different robot-football based robots. \n\n* [RoboSub](http://www.robonation.org/competition/robosub) for autonomous underwater robots.\n\n* [UAVchallenge](https://uavchallenge.org/about/) An Australian based drone competition.\n\n####Robotics Development Kits\n\n\n* [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) The Arduino microcontrollers is very easy to program in C, and is ideal for controlling electronics, servos, and sensors.\n\n* [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) is a single board computer, and is great for robotics projects that require more computing power than an Arduino, such as computer vision, of graphical interfaces.\n\n[^This ^Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vhvnaWUZjE) ^(explains the difference between an Arduino and a Raspberry Pi.)\n\n* [BeagleBone Boards](http://beagleboard.org/bone) Raspberry Pi before it was cool, these single board computers (SBC's) can be considered as a more advanced Pi, though there is an extra difficulty with them.\n\n* [STM32 F4 Discovery](http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/evaluation-tools/product-evaluation-tools/mcu-eval-tools/stm32-mcu-eval-tools/stm32-mcu-discovery-kits/stm32f4discovery.html) Another SBC for adults, not recommended without prior experience in computer science and programming, but capable of a lot more than any Arduino or Pi, if you know how to use it.\n\n\n\n####Education\n\n* University. Pure robotics degrees are hard to find, but similar courses such as Mechatronics or Electro-Mechanical Engineering do exist. Call the universities you're interested in and ask about what courses they offer.\n\n* Online Education. [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/), [Lynda](https://www.lynda.com/) offer a wide variety of courses related to robotics, from Python for beginners, to Machine Learning.\n\n\n#FAQ\n\n##What is a Robot?\nAccording to wikipedia \"A robot is a mechanical or virtual agent, usually an electro-mechanical machine that is guided by a computer program or electronic circuitry. Robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous and range from humanoids to industrial robots, collectively programmed 'swarm' robots, and even microscopic nano robots. By mimicking a lifelike appearance or automating movements, a robot may convey a sense of intelligence or thought of its own.\"\n\nOr put simply, a robot is a machine capable of making decisions based on the analysis of it's environment., and then acting on them.\n\n##Are Robots going to kill us all?\nNo, don't be silly. As this [XKCD](http://what-if.xkcd.com/5/) explains robots are no match to their human counterparts. A [War games](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHWjlCaIrQo) scenario could occur, but I'd sooner trust Windows *Vista* over most of the worlds politicians when it comes to our nukes. Hopefully, robots will take over the world one day, by freeing us from the drudgery of our nine-to-five jobs!\n\n##Will Robots eventually steal all our jobs?\nTo para-phrase  a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/1wcxz2/will_robots_eventually_steal_all_of_our_jobs_what/) by /u/ThatInternetGuy\nHumans weren't born to do jobs. Ultimately, we should be doing what we love and money shouldn't be the barrier. Robots replacing humans in doing all jobs is the ultimate goal in any society. If one day robots can autonomously manufacture our food, clothes, houses etc, it will leave us free to pursue the finer things in life. People will still be needed to design clothes, paint paintings etc, but unemployment would no longer be viewed as a bad thing, instead as a normality.\n\nHowever, none of us can predict the future, and it's worth pointing out that people thought that we'd all be out of a job when the [machines replaced the production of cloth in the 1800's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite), the same thing was said about the rise of the production line, and again for computers. In reality, new machines create new jobs, and improve our quality of life along the way.\n\n##I'm brand new, where do I start?\nThe best time to start build robots is about age eight. The second best time is right now!\nWe highly recommend team based robotics. In the real world you'll be part of a team, whether that be a mechanic in a garage or the lead designer of a new car. Teamwork is an invaluable skill to learn. \n\nIf you are flying solo, either buy a [lego Mindstorms kit](http://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms/?domainredir=mindstorms.lego.com), or if you're feeling ambitious, an [Arduino robot](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Robot). We recommend an Arduino, as you'll not only learn how to program a robot, but also the basic electronics, mechanics, and component selection, to make a great robot. Again, robotics is best done as part of a team, if you're in the education system, talk to your teacher about it, if not, find some friends and go for it!\n\nWe invite you to check our [Resources section](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/wiki/resources) to find more about Clubs, Competitions and Courses on Robotics !\n\n \n##How do I make a Robot?\nIt's advised to start with a team, and with a Robotics kit. \n\nRobotics is the multidisciplinary field, meaning it's the combination of design, electronics, maths, computer sciences &amp; mechanics. When you're part of a team, you'll be able to motive each other, bounce ideas back and forth (Read: Argue), and split the workload. You'll also enjoy it more with a team (Despite the arguments).\n\nStarting with a robotics kit is a great idea because it reduces your risk of failure. Robots are fantastically good at failing to perform, if you buy a kit, you get pre-fab electronics that are guaranteed to work, a chassis that won't immediately break when you first test it, and help, via an instruction book or online forums.\n\nOnce you've built the basic kit robot, you can start to modify it to your own ideas:\n\n1. **Keep it simple.** A [line following robot](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf-V-giXiRw) is a good place to start. Then maybe add a pincer, so that it can grab a object\n2. **Budget your cost.** Total up the cost of all the electronics, software, materials etc you'll need, then double it. The more robots you build, the better you'll get at pricing them. But seeing as you're new, expect to make mistakes. Mistakes are good because you learn from them! But they are expensive as well.\n3. **Budget your time.** Build your robot asap. A robot is an ongoing development process. You build it, test it, modify it, test it... until your deadline. Too many times have I seen (and been a part of) teams who spend far to long designing and prototyping brilliant ideas, only to leave themselves with no time to actually build the thing and make it work. So build your robot as soon as you can, then start coming up with clever solutions to your problems. \n\nI know that may seem a bit basic, but really, it's down to you. In the future we'll hopefully add links to guides for the basics of design, electronics, mechanics, and programming. But all the internet tutorials in the world won't measure up to the experience you gain from actually getting out there are doing it. Now go forth and build, program, test, &amp; improve!\n\n##Which robot should I make next?\n\nWhat problem are you trying to solve, and how does the robot make life better?\n\n# Resources\n \n\n## Basics Skills \n\nThese are the skills absolute needed if you want to work with robotics. \n\n* **Mathematics**: basic calculus and algebra is advised to start learning about robotics\n\n* **Programming**: If you want to give some intelligence to a robot, learning a programming language will be a necessity:\n    *C, C++, Python* are the more advised programming languages for robotics but more programming languages you know, the more assets you can bring while developing robotics software.\n\n* **Electronics**: If you want to start your own project with hardware, you should start learning basic electronics and build your skill with some basic projects !.\nTutorials are plenty on Youtube or hardware stores sites like Adafruit or Sparkfun !\n\n--------------------------\n\n## Moocs and Online Courses\n\nThese courses are meant to be a first step into Robotics. \nCourses in Maths/Computer Science are always a plus (and sometimes a must) before tackling this kind of course.\n\nCheck *edx,Coursera,Udacity* and even Youtube for more online courses!\n\n###Control Theory\n\n* [Control System Lecture with Brian Douglas on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/ControlLectures)\n\n* [Bootcamp on Optimal and Modern Control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi7l8mMjYVE&amp;list=PLMrJAkhIeNNR20Mz-VpzgfQs5zrYi085m) with Steve Brunton\n\n* Introduction to 6DOF robot Inverse Kinematics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3s2x4QsD3uM\n\n###Computer Vision\n\n* [Udacity: Introduction to Computer Vision\nby Georgia Institute of Technology](https://eu.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-computer-vision--ud810)\n\n###Machine Learning\n\n* The [Coursera Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) by Andrew Ng. \nAn excellent introduction of Machine Learning\n\n###Estimation-Localization, Path planning\n\n* [Udacity Artificial Intelligence for Robotics](https://eu.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-for-robotics--cs373)\n\n###Generalist courses\n\n* [Robotics: Kinematics and Mathematical Foundations from PennX](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:PennX+ROBO1x+1T2017/course/). \nAn introduction to Mathematics for Robotics.
