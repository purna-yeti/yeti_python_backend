A medical practitioner might read a clinical study and think \"how can I apply this to my medical practise\". A scientist on the other hand assumes the null hypothesis and only accept the finding if the methodology is of high quality, namely has managed to control all of the potential biases. Which is to say, you should always read a paper and consider all the ways it could be wrong - compare it to other papers in the field and related fields (often standards of evidence can vary dramatically between related fields, for example pharmacological vs nonpharmacological clinical trials). Consider all the possible sources of bias and look at how the authors have tried to control for it. Generally no study is perfect, so you will categorise papers into quality grades - for me it is \"suggestive\" quality evidence (interesting, but not generalisable), \"moderate\" quality evidence (generalisable but with significant caveats) and \"high\" quality evidence. In medical science, most studies fit into the \"suggestive\" and \"moderate\" categories. \"High\" quality evidence is reserved for findings that are found to be very robust in meta-analyses. In epidemiology, \"high\" quality evidence is that which is found in longitudinal population based studies (which helps minimise participation/selection/ecological biases) with high quality objective outcomes.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1615989480, "gildings": {}, "id": "gr8jvjb", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_m6z0tn", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_m6z0tn", "permalink": "/r/AskScienceDiscussion/comments/m6z0tn/books_on_learning_how_to_read_scientific_papers/gr8jvjb/", "retrieved_on": 1615989492, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "AskScienceDiscussion", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vlah", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1615989480.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "DerpyNerdy", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_fh3y6", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Hey, guys, complete newb here.

I'm going to assume that you're looking for a position as an academic research tech or a software developer, and you come from a life sciences background. As a starting point, I would echo u/apfejes and u/black_rose_'s suggestions to build a wishlist of skills, fields, and day-to-day tasks. For dev-like work (ex. extending and maintaining popular academic software, commercial research software, managing pipelines) I'd recommend the following program:\n\n* Theory: Learn the fundamentals of computer science properly. I can't emphasize this enough. Take classes (formal university ones, if covered, or one of the streams from Coursera or EdX). Don't try to design your own curriculum- it's inefficient. Know your way around algorithms and data structures at a 2nd year undergraduate level. \n   * The Cormen Introduction to Algorithms (credit: u/whyoy) is a good reference text.\n* Overview: Optional. If your university offers bioinformatics at the graduate level, take that. Otherwise, the [Coursera genomics stream](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics) is a good launchpad, in the sense that it familiarizes you with the start-to-finish process of analyzing genomic data. \n* Specialization: Lots of ways you can do this. My recommendation is to pick two fields, dive deep into one, and get a surface understanding of the other. \n   * One way to really get in the weeds of a field and practice your software engineering skills is to pick a methods development paper with publicly available data and try to recreate all of their figures. Read the background and document your process.\n   * If you're already working on transcriptomics, I agree with u/hoondy and u/darkhuman28 that (human) scRNAseq is a natural extension. Use the above approach to 'learn' a pipeline. Rahul Satija's Seurat is ubiquitous.   \n   * scRNAseq is a bit too specific to have its own textbook, but [this](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4939-9240-9) is a good overview of single cell techniques. I don't recommend buying textbooks unless you're at the stage where you don't know what you don't know, with exceptions.  \n   * Machine learning should be the default 'surface-learning' topic. Applied ML is a natural companion to transcriptomics data (ex. data imputation, phenotype prediction, combining transcriptomics with histology for computer vision studies, etc.). Don't get too bogged down in the math and statistics- learn it insofar as you know when *not* to use a technique. \n* Practice: Focus on getting to a point in your research project(s) that you'll have camera-ready deliverables you can put on Github. If you still have time, practice with problems [ROSALIND](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com).  \n   * Spend some time learning the fundamentals of software engineering best practices (ex. coding conventions, unit-testing, Git, debugging, documentation). \n   * This stream from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/engineering-practices-secure-software-quality) and this one from [EdX](https://www.edx.org/course/software-engineering-essentials) cover the basics. \n   * While doing all of the above, you're probably getting a lot of Python and command-line practice, at least. If you had truly obscene amounts of time, I'd say learn another OOP language like C++. Otherwise, learn a database language like OpenSQL. 'Learn' as in, 'I intuitively understand how to pseudocode in this language', not 'learn exhaustively'.\n\nA tangential suggestion- if you have time, consult your university's career office for alternate career paths. Bioinformatics curricula are notoriously flexible and there's nothing stopping you from building a CV for, say, project management, investment banking, equity research, or data analytics. If you decide that corporate careers are for you, put time towards honing your presentation skills, and instead of going hard on computational theory, section off 50% of your learning time for statistics and/or getting additional certifications (ex. project management).", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1615971197, "gildings": {}, "id": "gr7w0vc", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_m6khqd", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_m6khqd", "permalink": "/r/bioinformatics/comments/m6khqd/i_have_15_years_to_learn_enough_skills_to_be/gr7w0vc/", "retrieved_on": 1615971208, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "bioinformatics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0x", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1615971197.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "deadpan2297", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "9b5dcc4c-6e77-11e8-adee-0ed29bbad770", "author_flair_text": "Mathematical Biology", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6uh6a", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "I knew that name was familiar.

Therefore please take my advice with a pinch of salt but if it helps; here's a bit of a review of what I've tried so far:  \n\n\nDepending upon how good your Python skills are, I really recommend [dataquest.io](https://dataquest.io). It teaches Python from scratch and does a deep dive on Numpy &amp; Pandas. It then covers a Data Science pathway that covers the scikit-learn library in-depth and more high level coverage of other areas (inc. Spark). The whole pathway is 250 hrs and last I checked was about $30-50 pcm (cheaper annual package). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've also started the MIT MicroMasters (on EDX). This is very heavy on the Maths. I've enjoyed it but found it very challenging. It's $1,100 but follows a strict schedule. I've read elsewhere that the MIT course is like learning how to build a plane from scratch, and then learn how to fly it - and so there are more suitable courses if all you want to do is learn how to fly a plane.   \n\n\nI've just about finished a Coursera module on the maths of machine learning - this is to help boost my maths for the MIT [https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning)\n\n  \nNext up for me is an IBM module, probably starting this weekend [https://www.coursera.org/specializations/advanced-data-science-ibm](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/advanced-data-science-ibm)  \n\n\nOne to avoid. I tried this Data Science path by Michigan University. I didn't rate it at all. I knew most of what they were teaching from DataQuest and I still found it confusing so I quite after completing the 1st module. [https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python)  \n\n\nAs a final thought, it sounds like you've already found your chosen area of Data Science and are going to get a masters in it. Do you really need the 2nd masters from local college? If you're going to be an expert in Eduction maybe just look to boost your DS skills with some specialist Coursera modules, etc - rather than pay a lot of money for a 2nd masters (no idea how much local college costs). But anyway, hopefully someone more qualified than me will give some insight on the latter point.   \n\n\nBest of luck!", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1614892559, "gildings": {}, "id": "gpp6y1e", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_lxteof", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_lxteof", "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/lxteof/is_coursera_a_good_place_to_start/gpp6y1e/", "retrieved_on": 1615038615, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "datascience", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1614892559.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "BleederInMyKitchen", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_aw2fn", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Sports and do this short course on learning how to learn.

Read [Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software](http://charlespetzold.com/code)\n2. [Exploring How Computers Work](https://youtu.be/QZwneRb-zqA)\n3. Watch all 41 videos of [A Crash Course in Computer Science](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo)\n4. Take the [CS50: Introduction to Computer Science](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) course.\n5. Take the [Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris (Project-Centered Course)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer)\n6. Grab a copy of [C programming: A Modern Approach](http://knking.com/books/c2/index.html) and use it as your main course on C. You can also use [Modern C](https://modernc.gforge.inria.fr/)\n7. Follow this [Tutorial on Pointers and Arrays in C](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pointer-tutorial/)\n\nThe first Five really helped by approaching C from a lower level of abstraction (actually the absolute lowest level and gradually adding layers of abstraction until you are at the C level which, by then is incredibly high!) You can do all fivr or pick one or two and dive deep. The sixth is just the best tutorial on C. By far. The seventh is a deep dive into pointers and one of best tutorial on pointers out there (caveat, it's a little loose with the l-value/r-value definition for simplicity sake I believe.)\n\n[Play the long game when learning to code.](\nhttps://stackoverflow.blog/2020/10/05/play-the-long-game-when-learning-to-code/) \n\nYou can also check out [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)\n\nHere is a decent list of [8 Books on Algorithms and Data Structures For All Levels](https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/books-about-data-structures-algorithms)", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1614872568, "gildings": {}, "id": "gpnvoni", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_lxiajg", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_lxiajg", "permalink": "/r/cprogramming/comments/lxiajg/beginner_to_c/gpnvoni/", "retrieved_on": 1615014526, "score": 3, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "cprogramming", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rzb3", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1614872568.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "dcmdmi", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1kvipko0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Sounds like you need a break.
