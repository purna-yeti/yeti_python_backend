One of our security team members was an English teacher in a previous life &amp; is great at catching subtle differences in meaning in regs, audit responses, etc. This also makes you a better learner because you learn how to think critically through an argument, and how to criticize others' reasoning and thus by extension how to criticize your own reasoning.\n\n100% agree with the statement about risk management as well, because once you understand the concepts behind it you realize you are going through that process in literally everything you do every day. Your brain is consciously or unconsciously making risk management decisions every second. Just like the OODA Loop -- once you really understand what it is and how it works you realize its *everywhere*.\n\nI'm going to talk to you endlessly now about learning how to learn. This is one of my biggest passions in life and if I had to choose one single skill that would have the most effect on your life trajectory in it would probably be this one. Be a lifelong autodidact, in the sense of being a self-motivated self-learner of a wide variety of subjects, [absolutely do not be like this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/iamverysmart/comments/7jktw3/hes_very_knowledgeable_in_a_great_deal_of_matter/). Decide now that you will commit the rest of your life to learning how to learn better, and you will by extension become better at *everything* because these skills will help you in literally everything you do.\n\nFor learning how to learn, this free course on Coursera will be perfect for you: https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn\n\nThe biggest problems you will encounter when learning any new subject are (a) drawing a line around the topic so you can bound it and (b) identifying your knowledge gaps. \n\nTo help bound the topic, read over the relevant wikipedia page(s) but don't worry when you don't know everything on it, just get the gist of the scope of the topic. Then when you get a textbook follow this basic process I believe I got [from this remarkable book by the chairman of the Encyclopedia Brittanica](https://fs.blog/how-to-read-a-book/):\n\n1. Read front &amp; back cover, inside front &amp; back cover, table of contents, preface/intro. Slowly. Seriously, slowly read the \"expanded\" table of contents and think about the topics it has listed. This establishes the framework in your mind for how the topic you will learn is structured and what it contains. Then put it down &amp; come back later. (next day, same day few hours later, whatever)\n2. Flip through the whole book 1 page at a time glancing at each page for 1-2 seconds. Do not try to \"read\" it just let headings/diagrams jump out at you as you go. This could take 10-30 minutes. Put it down &amp; come back later.\n3. Flip through book again 1 page at a time, this time 3-5 seconds per page. Again don't \"read\" but this time let the bolded terms, definitions, etc jump out at you as you go. Could take 20-60 minutes. Put it down &amp; come back later. (I'd probably give a day or so between most of these steps unless it is a short book)\n4. Start with first chapter, flip through it again 3-5 seconds per page. This is your refresher. Walk away for a little while (half hour maybe? up to you) then sit down &amp; **read analytically** taking copious notes. \n\nIf you do that you basically \"read\" the book at least 3 times, twice with the fast skimming and once thoroughly. And it uses the power of spaced repetition to some extent which you will learn about in the Coursera course.\n\nBuy the book linked, don't just read the review at FS, the book is so much better than just the high level review.\n\nIdentifying knowledge gaps is *hard* if you are self-learning, because you don't have an expert to guide you. Tests are great for debugging knowledge gaps if you have them available, just remember they are testing a specific set of study material usually so it helps to have studied that material first.\n\nAnother great way to identify knowledge gaps is to use the \"Feynman Method\" of learning. Basically, take a piece of paper/whiteboard/whatever and at the top write the topic you want to learn. Then on the paper begin writing out an explanation of it as if you were teaching it to someone or a class and this was your whiteboard. As you write/talk, when you get to a point you don't understand you've identified a knowledge gap, so go fill it. [Here's a good video and article on how to do it.](https://collegeinfogeek.com/feynman-technique/) Pay attention to the point about asking \"Why?\" &lt;-- ensure you can answer \"Why?\" questions for concepts as much as possible.\n\nWhen taking notes, answer \"why does this work\" and use lots of analogies, metaphors, diagrams, etc. Recognize that these are mental models you are constructing and all models are wrong but some are useful, so construct different models/diagrams/explanations from different points of view to think through a concept from multiple angles. For example, networking can be thought of as packets crossing a wire (physical viewpoint) but also as information flowing through channels (information theory viewpoint) and also as nodes in a graph (graph theory viewpoint) and even from a biology standpoint in a sense as network diagrams start to look like diagrams of energy flow channels inside cells.\n\nThat article also links to Scott Young's video which was also where I first heard of it. It also links to this [great Cal Newport article on Feynman Notebooks](http://calnewport.com/blog/2015/11/25/the-feynman-notebook-method/) which are slightly different but related. Coincidentally I have a document on my computer at work titled \"Things I Don't Know Yet\" so these are very powerful tools.\n\nOne key attribute that separates the expert from the average is that the expert has finely honed skills in self-analysis -- understanding the limits of their knowledge, understanding how to rapidly learn new concepts, understanding how to debug gaps in knowledge, and understanding how to link concepts together to build new knowledge. The skills above will help build the foundation for you to develop your own knowledge base as rapidly as possible and to develop the linkages in your notes between concepts -- these links are the foundation of new knowledge.\n\nHope that helps!", "created_utc": 1553945842, "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "ejq6jdg", "link_id": "t3_b6de3r", "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_ejkksq8", "permalink": "/r/SecurityCareerAdvice/comments/b6de3r/need_advice/ejq6jdg/", "retrieved_on": 1553945842, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "SecurityCareerAdvice", "subreddit_id": "t5_t483x", "updated_utc": 1554103365, "created": 1553945842.0}, {"author": "isaeus-", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2wo0clcj", "author_patreon_flair": false, "body": "Except that's not how AI works. \n\nHow does this AI know when it's completed it's task, or if it's closer or further than its intended goal?

He was around when some of these fundamental algorithms were made, and is a fantastic lecturer! There's an excellent book that accompanies the lectures, but he distills the core ideas very efficiently. There's another person involved in the course, but Rob is the one speaking for most of it.\n\nIf you're doing machine translation though, that probably won't be a bottleneck. You should consider learning some ML basics. Try Bishop's Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning if you want to just read, or  MacKay's Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms if you want to work through exercises as you do stuff. Another interesting book is Pattern Theory, which covers some language understanding basics in the first few chapters in a fun way.\n\nIf your program is DL-oriented, think about Andrew Karpathy's DL course, or similar. There's also a Deep Learning book https://www.deeplearningbook.org/ and OpenAI's \"getting started\" recommendations (but they're focused on reinforcement learning, which you probably want t o defer until you've learned the basics).\n\nIf you did a math undergrad, you should be fine learning the math for your ML program. It doesn't go very deep, and any reasonably capable math undergraduate should be able to handle it. Were I in your place, my bigger concern would be whether I would be interested in doing this for 4-5 years without knowing anything about it!

This MIT MicroMaster's is the only online course I've seen which isn't like that.  I've only completed the first course so far, in probability, but it was hardcore.  It's the only online course I ever saw where the forums are full of people complaining about how hard it is.  It is also a steal relative to a real masters, at about $1200 for four online courses.

[This course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/regression-models) was poorly explained in my opinion and turned me off of any more JHU data science courses.
