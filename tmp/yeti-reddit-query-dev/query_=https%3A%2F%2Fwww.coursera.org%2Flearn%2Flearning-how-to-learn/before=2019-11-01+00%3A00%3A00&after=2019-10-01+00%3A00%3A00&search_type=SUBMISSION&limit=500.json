Now I've decided that I want to start at the beginning; but I just don't know where that beginning is. I've seen books that seem standard recommended to other people, but I wouldn't be a good judge of whether they're good for people who have no experience with circuit/hardware designs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor reference, I'm a software guy. I'm into functional programming, and the most contact I've had with FPGAs and HW designs is playing around with Vivado for a couple of months at my last job, and doing the first part of the Nand2Tetris course on coursera ([https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer)).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat books and/or tutorials do you think I should start with?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "FPGA", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sf3o", "subreddit_subscribers": 14722, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Step-by-step on how to become a competent hardware programmer?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572167825, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FPGA/comments/dktyoo/stepbystep_on_how_to_become_a_competent_hardware/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1571625318.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "socialistvegan", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4avd6", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570041764, "domain": "self.webdev", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/dceg0p/selfteaching_webdev_in_4_months_with_the_goal_of/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dceg0p", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/webdev/comments/dceg0p/selfteaching_webdev_in_4_months_with_the_goal_of/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1570041766, "score": 2, "selftext": "Hey guys, so I've been lurking this and a few other programming subreddits for the last year or so.\n\nI've messed around with Swift over the last few years, and back in my teens built a few websites with HTML/javascript, and ran an online MUD where I took a pre-existing C(+?) codebase and just heavily edited it to add new character classes, abilities, features, etc. Pretty much very basic stuff, but through these experiences I at least know that I actually find coding really interesting and fun.\n\nI've been in the same unrelated industry for the last 10 years, and have throughout that time always had a lingering curiosity about an alternate life in programming. Over the last year or so I've started to more seriously contemplate the possibility of teaching myself some stuff that might allow me to switch career paths and eventually support myself remotely.\n\nThe reason this has all become much more relevant is because my girlfriend has decided to finally pursue her dreams of working for an NGO abroad. She's spent the last 5 years following me around the country as I pursued my career, now I want to be supportive of her in the same way. The timeline for this move is within the next 3-6 months.\n\nThe immediate issue this presented me with is how the hell I'm going to continue to bring in income while working abroad, likely in a developing country.\n\nThe last year or so of lurking these communities has led me to believe that webdev seems to be the track that is most likely to give me a chance to freelance and work remotely with some level of flexibility and a relatively low barrier to entry.\n\nMy idea of how this will all go is that I'll hopefully be able to learn the ropes over the next few months, and then work on finding small freelance webdev jobs. Given the parts of the world we'll be living in, all I really need to be able to make is $500-$1000 a month and that will be more than enough to supplement my girlfriend's salary.\n\nIs this realistic, or am I totally off base on my expectations?\n\nAs far as a curriculum for webdev, I figured I'd start off with these:\n1) https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn\n2) https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/\n3) https://www.theodinproject.com\n\nDo you all think that would be sufficient to get me ready to take on some small jobs?\n\nAny other advice?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "webdev", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qs0q", "subreddit_subscribers": 382340, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Self-teaching webdev in &lt;4 months, with the goal of being able to make a few hundred bucks a month while living abroad", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570128151, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/dceg0p/selfteaching_webdev_in_4_months_with_the_goal_of/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1570041764.0}]
