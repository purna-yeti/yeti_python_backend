You can skip it if you're not interested in this field. Can't say that about his AI podcast with the giants of various industries, it's worth listening to.\n\nThere are two types of courses: with bottom-up or top-down approach. You can think of it like this:\n\nYour task is to build a car. At first you can learn to drive one to understand what you should be focusing on: maybe you'd like a softer suspension, or you really like the roar of the engine, etc. And then learn how the car works, what it's internal components are and so forth. That's the top-down approach.\n\nBottom-up is the opposite. First you'll build a car, and then you'll learn how to drive it and how to make it perfect.\n\nThere are pros and cons to both of the styles. Bottom-up will teach you how the neural network works, it'll not be a black box for you, but where's the fun of that? You need some practice to support the theory, and until you know how to build a fully-fledged NN, you'd not be able to 'test drive' it. And, as I said before, there's a lot of nuances about the NN application.\n\nTop-down will teach you to work with the NN first, and then you'll build it. Again, it may be good for you to know what to look for when you're digging deep into the theory afterwards, but at first it'll be a big bad mess to understand, because you don't know why is it working, what the gradients are, what is this fancy sounding 'loss' and 'activation' functions, what is this 'gradient descent', etc.\n\nIn my opinion, I'd suggest trying top-down approach first. Practice makes perfect in the field of DL.\n\nIf you did some projects on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) (data science competitions website) and somewhat sure what you did, you can start with the [fast.ai](https://course.fast.ai) course. It's a 2-part course and it has top-down approach - you'll learn to apply neural networks to various tasks, and after the first part you'll be getting deeper into the theory. Also it's worth noting that Jeremy Howard knows **a lot** about practical aspects of DL and it's worth watching the first part, you'll get some cool insights and state-of-the-art approaches.\n\nIf you're not sure in your level, I'd recommend [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning). On the contrary to the fast.ai course, it has bottom-up approach. It's a bit outdated, but it'll teach you enough of the basics to dive into fast.ai course.\n\nI've taken both courses, starting with DL Specialization. I knew enough to try to compete on Kaggle, but the lack of practice and 'high-level' understanding was my doom, so I didn't perform well in the challenges. But it's okay, with more practice of applying and debugging the models you'll learn more.\n\nEdit: if you want to learn more advanced topics, you should join the forums and discussions where the active practitioners are. There's a lot of introductory courses, but I haven't seen one with some advanced topics like ensembling, architecture search and so forth (frankly, I never looked for them). Also I'd recommend reading the [research papers](http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/), even if not a lot of them are reproducible.

However, if you're truly passionate about programming and think you have the logic to at least get a semi-high paying job, then go for it. I don't know much about the other professions you're interested in, but if you still want to program, I suggest first learning the basics of Python (you already know C# and C++, so this should be relatively easy as you just need to adapt to the new syntax, programming languages are very similar logically, just slightly vary in structure). Then, after practicing with some random problems you find online, you should take  [https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) and  [https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2?](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2?) , free online courses that touch on the basics of complex algorithms provided by Princeton University. You can also check out the links I sent you before and read that MIT algorithms book if you find that you're actually talented (if you start struggling, you might not have the intellect to be a top programmer, but you can still go work at a random startup near you and earn &gt;100k, just look for opportunities). \n\nIf you start heavily struggling though, and begin to have trouble thinking and problem-solving like the majority of people who want to program (but aren't smart enough to do so at a high-level), this field might not be for you, so dip and become a freelance commentator or some shit.\n\n**\"LIAR!!!! You found my age from this post\"**\n\nNah, I never lie, I didn't see your age from that post, I saw it from some comment you made that went something like \"30th birthday in a few days, what should I do for it\", I just pressed my middle mouse button and dragged my cursor down to the bottom of the page to accelerate and maximize the scrolling velocity.\n\n**\"Some people are meant for menial roles yes, I agree with that.\"**\n\nI don't know man, soon, automation is gonna completely take over nearly all blue-collar jobs, meaning that those who aren't at the top intellectually, those who do braindead work that can be completely replaced by robots and algorithms will be rendered useless (such as a packer, who's job is essentially calling an algorithm over and over again). You have a fair point, but in my eyes, people like that are just another retarded andy, another random, typical meaningless guy that will never provide nothing to society, while robbing us from our scarce natural resources and oxygen (at least in the coming years of automation).\n\nYou're right, I may be a toxic ass zoomer, but I consider myself a deeply knowledgeable/intellectual 5Head.\n\nIf you actually want to make a new beginning for yourself and become a dev, I hope that helps\n\nHmu on Discord @ CorporalSpoon31#0536 if you want more links, have questions, or if you've made any general progress in programming by following the links I sent.\n\nYou know, the internet is amazing, never thought I'd be speaking to some 30-year-old 3Head who watches xQc.\n\nCheers m8 oi 3Head", "created_utc": 1571604432, "gildings": {}, "id": "f4ii40p", "is_submitter": true, "link_id": "t3_dkf04e", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_f4hzhmw", "permalink": "/r/xqcow/comments/dkf04e/when_youre_there_for_the_forsaaaaan_pepegapls/f4ii40p/", "retrieved_on": 1571610454, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "xqcow", "subreddit_id": "t5_flhe9", "total_awards_received": 0, "created": 1571604432.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "_DreadLockRasta", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2wr0h75h", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "body": "I 100% reccomend  princeton's algorithms courses on coursera.

In particular, a couple of courses I'd recommend are:\n\n* [Methods and Statistics in Social Sciences](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/social-science) - This is particularly focused on quantitative methods in the social sciences (including quite a bit on behavioural and self-report research) so I'm not sure if it will be directly relevant with respect to neuroimaging and cognitive neuroscience, but this gives a great introduction to research methods in general. I've actually only done the first course in this series (Quantitative Research Methods), but they're very comprehensive and well made, so I'm confident that the whole series will be useful for any researcher. \n* [Probability and statistics: To p or not to p?](https://www.coursera.org/learn/probability-statistics/home/welcome) - This one is a little bit more maths-heavy so might be a bit intimidating if you don't find that sort of material easy, but it's a good introduction to some of the core concepts in quantitative research, including some you mentioned (e.g. probability distributions). You don't really have to fully engage with or grasp the maths for it to be useful either.\n\nIn terms of textbooks, I personally use Andy Field's [Discovering Statistics Using R](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Discovering-Statistics-Using-Andy-Field/dp/1446200469), and find that very helpful. Field is a psychologist who is very open about his difficulties with learning statistics, and I've found it quite useful and re-assuring to learn from someone with that mindset. He's also tried writing a statistics textbook in the form of a graphic novel, [An Adventure in Statistics: The Reality Enigma](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Adventure-Statistics-Reality-Enigma/dp/1446210456), so if that sounds like something that might help you, check it out.\n\nI think a few people from a 'purer' statistics background are a bit more critical about Field's books because they're not as comprehensive as a book written by, for example, a statistics professor - and there might be some advice in there that's a little bit out-of-date or not quite correct. He also has a very hit-and-miss cheesy sense of humour, which you'll either love or find very annoying. But I think he takes the right sort of approach for helping people who aren't necessarily mathematically-inclined to dip their toes into the world of statistics.", "created_utc": 1571049692, "gildings": {}, "id": "f3p8l8m", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_dhod2f", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_dhod2f", "permalink": "/r/AskStatistics/comments/dhod2f/resources_to_learn_statistics_for_research/f3p8l8m/", "retrieved_on": 1571049693, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "AskStatistics", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sioa", "total_awards_received": 0, "created": 1571049692.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "lainondev", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4opxnrf2", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Grats, hope you have a good time. As someone who fucked up their first attempt at college (at UTK), I have a few words of advice that are probably obvious. However, you'll be shocked at the number of people who don't do these things:\n\n* Go to class. Don't get in the habit of skipping. Once you start justifying it to yourself it becomes easier and easier to do it again.\n* Learn effective study skills. Most people never learn how to study. I recommend completing this short, free online course to help you develop proper study skills: [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn).\n* Take advantage of the resources offered at UTK. Make a stop at career development in your first semester and make regular appointments to develop and work toward career goals. If you need help, talk to your professor or TA, or go to tutoring or academic coaching AS SOON AS YOU NEED THE HELP. Do not wait. \n* On that note, try to build relationships with your professors and other students. I failed miserably at this and it turns out that networking is one of the most important things you can do.\n* If you have a documented disability, get registered with disability services. \n* If you have trouble transitioning to university life or have trouble managing stress, stop by the counseling center. If you have a diagnosed mental illness, they've got a psychiatrist on staff who can help you manage your medications. There's also a pharmacy. \n* Look for something to get involved in. This can be undergraduate research, a student organization, anything at all that you find interesting.\n* Take care of your body. There are a lot of ways to get some exercise and eat healthier while you're on campus. A healthy body will help you maintain good mental health and perform well in your classes.", "created_utc": 1570987691, "edited": 1570987914.0, "gildings": {}, "id": "f3mg2tx", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_dh9slq", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_f3mafqy", "permalink": "/r/ockytop/comments/dh9slq/weekly_discussion_thread/f3mg2tx/", "retrieved_on": 1570988857, "score": 4, "send_replies": true, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ockytop", "subreddit_id": "t5_2v13w", "total_awards_received": 0, "created": 1570987691.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "BigLongDongSilver", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1608is", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "body": "So, I'm a bit late in responding to this, but I guess that's what I get for not sorting by new. I've seen a couple of people mention this, but no one has gone into detail, and talking about shit I'm not actually an expert in is one of my special talents.\n\nWhat you're describing isn't just common, but present in every person because of how your brain works. When you focus on a problem, the part of your brain that is active is mostly the prefrontal cortex, which does a bunch of heavy lifting in creating complex thoughts. But, when you don't already have the link between a problem and a solution, only using one part of your brain can be a hindrance. The solution is a mode of thinking commonly referred to as \"diffuse mode.\" In this mode of thinking, your brain is working at less speed and efficiency on a problem, but it is using multiple parts of your brain, where ideas and solutions can be connected to things previously not associated. \n\nSo what's the best way to go into diffuse mode? Not to focus. When you're working on your book, your brain will always have trouble making new connections, and the way to get around this will be to let your mind wander, while your brain is in a state that will allow new connections to form.\n\nIf you want to know more about this stuff, I highly recommend checking out Dr. Barbra Oakley, who made three things on this subject:\n   Her talk at google (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd2dtkMINIw), which is short and contains a bunch of good info,\n   Her online class (https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/), which has terrible greenscreen and a shitton of good info described in very understandable ways, \n   And her book, A Mind For Numbers, which reads like Oakley outlined her well-researched points described in a way only a veteran teacher could, and then gave a toddler a fucking crayon to connect them, so I don't actually recommend this one.\n\nAlso, sorry for spelling errors, I just do whatever Grammarly tells me.", "created_utc": 1570675586, "gildings": {}, "id": "f35emzn", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_dfgsba", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_dfgsba", "permalink": "/r/writing/comments/dfgsba/is_it_me_being_creative_when_some_of_the_best/f35emzn/", "retrieved_on": 1570675591, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "writing", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh2n", "total_awards_received": 0, "created": 1570675586.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "Dhalsim1", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5zqzq", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Just looked up this course, sorry to hear it sucks.

There is also a somewhat different version for kids &amp; teens ([this 2-page PDF](https://barbaraoakley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-Top-Ideas-to-Help-Your-Learning-and-10-Pitfalls-1.pdf)), from the more recent book by the author.", "created_utc": 1570181756, "gildings": {}, "id": "f2e5dkf", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_d25rwt", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_d25rwt", "permalink": "/r/ADHD/comments/d25rwt/managing_adhd_unmedicated/f2e5dkf/", "retrieved_on": 1570181758, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ADHD", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnwb", "total_awards_received": 0, "created": 1570181756.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "ziptofaf", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8e3wg", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "body": "In order for something to be considered deep learning you need to have multiple (hidden) layers. So for instance linear regression or Naive Bayes, despite both being machine learning, do not fall under deep learning. Neural networks generally are considered deep learning (with the exception of perceptrons as these effectively have just one layer).\n\nSo it's not about the problem you encounter but about the solution you employ. Recommender system doesn't necessarily need to utilize any deep learning algorithm. In fact the one employed in the [https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome) course (which I heavily recommend) utilizes collaborative filtering algorithm which, while definitely fits into unsupervised machine learning algorithm, cannot be classified as a deep learning solution.\n\nBut there are ways of using deep learning when making such a recommender system. The difference is essentially in whether you directly map set of inputs to an output (f(x) -&gt; y) or whether it's x -&gt; f(x) -&gt; g(f(x) -&gt; h(g(f(x)) -&gt; y. Technically you can tackle any problem that traditionally uses deep learning with a standard non-neural network based algorithm, the only question is how effective will it be. Eg. neural networks and deep learning are very good at working with images as they can create intermediate functions (like edge detection, blurring, focusing on a specific color, look for specific shapes etc) rather than directly try and decide whether a pile of 50000 pixels is a cat (this will be hard to accomplish with, say, basic logistic regression).", "created_utc": 1570123964, "edited": 1570124453.0, "gildings": {}, "id": "f2banud", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_dctzti", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_dctzti", "permalink": "/r/learnprogramming/comments/dctzti/machine_learning_project_vs_deep_learning_project/f2banud/", "retrieved_on": 1570127682, "score": 2, "send_replies": true, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "learnprogramming", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r7yd", "total_awards_received": 0, "created": 1570123964.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "SittingFox", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_uf7j7", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "body": "The best way to not discourage the student, in my opinion, would be to avoid making it out that there is something wrong with being behind.
