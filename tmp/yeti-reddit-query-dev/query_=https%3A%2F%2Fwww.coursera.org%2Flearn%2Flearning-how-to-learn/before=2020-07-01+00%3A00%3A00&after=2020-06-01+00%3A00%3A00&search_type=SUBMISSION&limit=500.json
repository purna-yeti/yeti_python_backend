Hopefully their mods will approve my post :)\n\nHello everyone!\n\nLately there has been a lot of interest and attention in the [University of London's Bachelor's in Computer Science](https://www.coursera.org/degrees/bachelor-of-science-computer-science-london/home/) degree. This is not without reason. After all, it's one of the *first* online Bachelor degrees in Computer Science!\n\nAs the degree itself is fairly new, there's not a lot of online coverage about it. With the next [application deadline](https://london.ac.uk/courses/computer-science#apply-now) (September 7th) a few months away, I decided to write a review of my own experiences as a student of the degree -- in hopes that the information I share will empower potential students to better decide whether or not this degree is the best for them.  I'll try my best to keep a relatively balanced and fair overview of the degree -- while keeping in mind that these are fundamentally my own experiences.\n\n## How is the online degree structured?\nAn online degree is different from the sort of paid classes or specialisations currently available on Coursera, so it helps to give a quick overview of how the degree is structured.\n\nThere are 22 classes called modules in this degree, plus a final project. You can enroll up to 4 modules per term (semester), for a maximum course-load of 8 modules per academic year.\n\n[This is how your course page looks like, when you login. See the individual modules?](https://i.imgur.com/7dV9ta4.png)\n\nEach module is organised into 20 - 22 \"weeks\" worth of material, separated into a midterm at week 10, and a final at week 20 - 22.\n\n[This is how your module page looks like.](https://i.imgur.com/48HW9oq.png)\n\n## What is the time commitment? Can I study this degree while having a full-time job/busy-family?\n\nActually, you could! The degree is designed as a *flexible* degree, specifically for professionals with full-time jobs. Many of my classmates have busy families, or full-fledged professional careers -- and they're still able to maintain a 4 module per term workload.\n\nThis works because the modules have flexible deadlines. All of your assignments have \"suggested\" weekly due dates. However, there are only two hard deadlines: the midterm (Week 10) and endterm (Week 20 - 22).\n\nThis means, that as long as you turn in all of your assignments from Weeks 1 - 9 before the hard deadline of Week 10, you are alright. This lets you structure your time so you can do more or less, depending on your schedule.\n\n## What are your own experiences in terms of the quality of modules?\n\nI was a member of the very first cohort of students, so I had a front-line view of the quality of the course. Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with the actual *material* itself in terms of the lectures and readings, especially for my current Level 5 classes.\n\n### Quality of Delivery\n\nAs the first cohort of the new degree, we had a pretty bumpy ride in the first term. **There were logistical issues and technical bugs when we first started our term**. For example, sometimes images would be missing from lecture slides -- or a download link doesn't work. It became pretty clear that we were beta-testers of something new, and we would get emails from the administration, informing us of changes or bugfixes as the weeks went on.\n\nAs far as I can tell, even though University of London has been running distance-learning degrees since the 19th century, this was the first time they've partnered with Coursera as a platform, and there were definitely pain points.\n\nStudents ended up organising a crowd-sourced bug tracker for the various issues, and as time went on, most of them got fixed. There's still some issues with things like incorrect diagrams, but as far as I can tell -- **the second cohort had far smoother ride than the first cohort did.**\n\n### Quality of Module Content\n**I'm overall satisfied with the actual material, especially with the level 5 modules.** You see, the modules are divided between [level 4 (introductory), level 5 (intermediate), and level 6 (specialised)](https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels) -- and for the first term especially, I felt that the level 4 modules were a mixed bag.\n\nI took Introduction to Web Development, Intro to Programming, and Numerical Mathematics that year. And the quality and difficulty of the material felt a bit inconsistent.\n\n#### Example 1: Intro to Programming\nIntro to Programming was really well done. It was a project-based module where we had to create our own video game by the end of the term, and the lecturers were engaged, the assignments challenging but fair, and overall I liked it.\n\n#### Example 2: Web Development\nBut the Web Development class felt much too simple at times, and I didn't feel like I learned a lot from the lectures. I'm probably a bit biased, as I have significant prior knowledge in web development, but a lot of it felt superficial or too easy. Some of my other classmates enjoyed it though, especially those without a background in web development.\n\n#### Example 3: Numerical Mathematics\nIn contrast, Numerical Mathematics as **very, very hard**. Over the span of 20 weeks, I wrote four or five different math papers, on some very difficult topics. [One of our first papers was a implementation of the RSA cryptosystem](https://i.imgur.com/lBYzQoM.png), followed by a discussion and cryptoanalysis (cracking) of said cipher. I have a math background, and *technically* the papers were optional -- but it took a lot of work, and a lot of stress. We covered *a lot* of content, and towards the end it felt like an intellectual death-march.\n\nI think what happened with the level 4 modules was that our professors didn't really know what to expect from an online course, and they tried to hit the balance in terms of material/difficulty, and they missed the mark on both sides.\n\nThere were lots of changes announced after the feedback from the first term, and they actually redesigned the entire Numerical Mathematics class this year.\n\nNow, since I'm on the third term now - I am beginning the Level 5 modules. And **I'm very satisfied with the level 5 courses.** They seem to be a huge step up in terms of polish, as well as the depth of the content, and I think things have improved greatly from before.\n\n## What's the 'creative' aspect of this degree? How are the project-based assignments like?\n\nOh! This is my favorite part about this degree specifically. **The entire degree has a strong project-based focus, where you make something at the end of most modules** This was one of the reasons I applied for this program, because I felt like a lot of computer science degrees are too theory-focused, with little emphasis on using the skills you learn to actually create something.\n\nThese creative projects are not graded very strongly, in the sense you could technically do the absolute minimum, and still \"pass\". But a lot of my classmates take this opportunity to really learn and apply skills on their own, and I feel like you end up learning way more in the process of making these projects.\n\nFor example, in our Intro. to Programming Class, we are tasked to make a 2D side scroller. Some people made the bare-minimum effort, but you also had a lot of creativity and talent. Here's a showcase of some of my classmate's efforts:\n\n* [Pixel Art Red Potato Man Game](https://i.imgur.com/Y3pEnBH.png)\n* [Pastel Panda Game](https://imgur.com/8U3jg0x)\n* [Japanese Forest Platformer](https://imgur.com/BEIcomN)\n\nAll of that cool pixel art, the animations, are technically not required for the grade. But the fact that my classmates did it anyways, is a beautiful demonstration of how *learning is driven from within*.\n\n## What's the student community like? Where do you go if you need help?\n\nPeople go to college not just for the lessons, but also for friendship, camaraderie, and networking opportunities. I was really worried at first that I won't be able to connect with anyone, and that I'll be studying all alone. But nothing could be farther from the truth.\n\n**There is a large, diverse, and vibrant student community on Slack -- filled with volunteers and helpful mentors**.\n\nEvery week, there are [virtual study sessions held over video-chat](https://i.imgur.com/I46h5k7.png), and during the weekends there are hangout sessions and gaming nights. A fellow student held an University of London [**indie game jam**](https://i.imgur.com/QCcQJy7.png), with dozens of entries. There's such a **close-knit sense of community** on Slack, that I'm amazed every day by the sort of things my classmates are up to.\n\nThere's never a moment where I felt stuck on my own, because [even the hardest questions or obscurest were tackled collectively and with friendship](https://i.imgur.com/SVRRt4H.png). Many video calls were had, many spreadsheets and websites made. If you ask a question on the Slack, you're pretty much guaranteed to have someone reply within 10 minutes, willing to help you to understand.\n\nI'm so honored to be with such a diverse and wonderful community, and I think a great deal of value from this degree -- is to have met these people. Out of my classmates **I've met Artists, Web Developers, Mathematicians, Businesspeople, Stockbrokers, Linux Kernel Hackers, and everyone in between.**\n\nThis degree is unlike any other, for all the classmates you have are people who *willfully choose to be there*. You all share this feeling of purpose, which makes it feel more than just a class.\n\nOut of all the issues we've had, the bugs, the frustrations, the late-night stress and sadness -- we all overcame it together, and my life has been made richer as a result.\n\n## Wow! Would you recommend this degree to someone?\n\nI'd say... yes -- but with certain caveats. This programme is unique, and one of it's kind -- and if you decide to join, **do expect there to be bugs and issues.** For better or worse, you'll be a trendsetter in the vanguard of a new paradigm in education. Likewise, it takes a *certain kind of person* to be successful at this degree.\n\nYou'll need to be willfully independent, and capable of setting your own pace. You'll need to learn for your own love of learning, rather than just for a grade. It can be so easy to just do the *bare minimum*, and not learn anything for it. But if you are the sort of person to go the extra mile, to add features to your projects even though they are optional -- to make things not because they are easy, but because they are hard -- than I think you'll be a good candidate for the class :)\n\nIt doesn't matter what your background in computing is, or whether or not you know how to code. As long as you have the spirit, you'll find a community of fellow souls who will be there every step of the way. :)\n\n----\n\nInterested? Feel free to ask me any questions in this thread.

Do a quick scan of some HTML tags and CSS, just enough to be able to build small things.\n\nPracticing is super important, start practicing at the beginner stage. The coding game challenges can be approached then, and if it's too much for you, then practice on what you learned. Tweak it, tune it, play with the material, and don't be afraid to break stuff.\n\nDevote the needed time! There are no shortcuts. There's no magic.

As a result, I made it a personal goal of mine to learn Python in 2020. Here's what changed for me (career wise).\n\nTo start, with all the wfh and lockdown, I'm pretty pleased with myself that I managed to complete 3 courses since January:\n\n1. Fundamental Comp Sci Python Course - [https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/) \n2. Python Excel Manipulation which was offered my local CFA Society in Toronto -  [https://marqueegroup.ca/course/python-1-core-data-analysis/](https://marqueegroup.ca/course/python-1-core-data-analysis/) \n3. Data Analysis with Python (teaches regression testing) -  [https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python) \n\nSince then, I was able to automate over 10 hours of work weekly by streamlining reports (things you'd normally have to spent hours doing copying/pasting financial data can now be done in a click). My code grabs multiple data files on a weekly basis, cleans the data, merges them together, and then loads it in a database and locks into Tableau as a dashboard. It's pretty freaking awesome.\n\n**Here's the downside.** After word got out of what I was able to do, everybodys now coming to me to build similar stuff for them (streamlining w/ python and loading into dashboards). I basically don't have anything else on my plate other than a backlog of these requests. My work allocation is severely one-sided.\n\nIn a recent catchup with my manager, he's even now lablled me as the \"IT guy\" on the team. And no disrepect to developers or anyone in IT, I did not study my CFA to become IT. So while everyone else on the team gets to work on things related to the business, I am told there is an opportunity for me to be promoted next year to \"lead IT work\"  As a result, I'm drifting further away from actual investment-related work, but more technology focused work.\n\nSo to all the people wanting to learn Python/Tableau and Data Science etc... Maybe it's better to spend the time refining investment-related knowledge and soft skills rather than learning to code and risk being labelled as \"IT\". I know this could very well be a one-off experience, but just wanted to share what had happened to me. I know tech is very lucrative still, but I'm not sure I'd ever be as good as actual software developers or analytics professionals.\n\nHappy to hear other people's experiences with Python and how being technical has/has not enabled them to progress in their careers.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "CFA", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rzsx", "subreddit_subscribers": 50184, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "[Career] So I learned Python after getting my CFA...", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CFA/comments/hc774s/career_so_i_learned_python_after_getting_my_cfa/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1592595286.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "SuikaCider", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_15lyx4", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1592209617, "domain": "self.languagelearning", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/h9c391/psa_free_coursera_course_learning_how_to_learn/", "gildings": {}, "id": "h9c391", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#0a006a", "link_flair_css_class": "resources", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Resources"}], "link_flair_template_id": "ed8a8c5a-d494-11e5-beea-0e4f9a8e143d", "link_flair_text": "Resources", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/languagelearning/comments/h9c391/psa_free_coursera_course_learning_how_to_learn/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1592209619, "score": 1, "selftext": "Recently there was a thread about [major breakthroughs in language learning](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/h8s78t/what_have_been_the_major_breakthroughs_in/) and u/taknyos plugged this Coursera course: [Learning how to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/)\n\n&gt;This course gives you easy access to the invaluable learning techniques used by experts in art, music, literature, math, science, sports, and many other disciplines.

A lot of people say that you need to have them or that you need to work on them. You often see headlines like \u201cSoft skills for professional developers\u201d or \u201cSoft skills vs Hard skills\u201d and unless you have already faced the issue in real life or are interested enough to google and do the research, it\u2019s difficult to have an opinion on the matter.\n\nLike, what even are soft skills? Do I actually need them? Can\u2019t I just, you know, talk to people?\n\nWell, yes, and no, and\u2026 Let me explain.\n\n**WHAT IS IT &amp; WHY SHOULD I CARE**\n\nCambridge Dictionary defines soft skills as \u201cpeople's abilities to communicate with each other and work well together\u201d. And it might come as a surprise, but web, game, software or any other type of development consists primarily of teamwork. \n\nThink about it this way: hard skills (skills that are required to do your job) are teachable and quantifiable. Yes, it takes persistence and time investment, but you eventually will learn to code. It\u2019s not a matter of \u2018if\u2019, but a matter of \u2018when\u2019. You simply need to dedicate enough time to acquire enough knowledge. And that\u2019s the main reason people tend to focus on hard skills when looking for a job. \n\nHowever, at the end of the day, you will be competing with the dudes who have the same amount of knowledge as you. They can do all the same things. So what will separate you from them? Well, experience, of course, but let\u2019s imagine that you compete with people without any experience whatsoever. So, all you have is your skillset which is ultimately the same as theirs. So how do you think employers will decide? They will choose the dude they liked. And this \u201clikability\u201d factor is heavily influenced by your soft skills. Was it easy to talk to you? Were you able to clearly present your ideas and experience? How would you fit in with the team?\n\nOf course, it goes beyond just the interview. At work, you will constantly have to communicate with other people, set tasks, and pitch your ideas. Your soft skills will definitely factor into all of this.\n\nLast year\u2019s [Linkedin Global Talent Trends](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/recruiting-tips/global-talent-trends-2019) report showed that 92% of professionals and hiring managers say that soft skills are just as important\u2013or more important\u2013than hard skills. [Furthermore](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-2019-talent-trends-soft-skills-transparency-trust-bersin), 91% of companies acknowledged a lack of soft skills as an issue and 80% of companies said that they are struggling to find employees with better soft skills in the market.\n\nAt the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, Elon Musk said \u201cA.I. will make jobs kind of pointless. People enjoy, fundamentally, interacting with other people. If you\u2019re working on something that involves people or engineering, it\u2019s probably a good approach\u201d.\n\nSoft skills are difficult to measure and difficult to acquire, but it doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s nothing you can do.\n\n**LIST OF SOFT SKILLS**\n\nLet\u2019s break all the soft skills down into nominal categories.\n\n**People skills** usually mean one\u2019s ability to respectfully communicate with other people and develop productive relationships. You want to be able to build trust and maximize pleasant interactions with your co-workers. \n\n**Social skills** also relate to social interactions with other people but are more focused on the goal of communication. They generally include the following:\n\n* **Coordination and social perceptiveness**. You need to be able to read the room and adjust your actions and behavior in response to other people\u2019s actions.\n* **Mentoring**. Teamwork will often mean not only constant learning but help and mentorship as well. You want to be able to clearly communicate your instructions and be able to explain certain aspects of your job.\n* **Negotiation and persuasion**. These skills will be instrumental in your interviews and different interactions with your employers, whether it is a salary negotiation or pitch of your idea.\n\n**Communication skills** are all about the actual means of communication and your ability to clearly state your thoughts and tasks. You want to be able to explain the motivation and reasoning behind your actions and ideas. Most of the disagreements in work (and outside of it) stem from poor communication. \n\n**Social and emotional intelligence** influence your ability to empathize with other people\u2019s emotions. They help you stay socially and self-aware, consider the feelings of other people (especially when making decisions), understand your environment, and react appropriately. \n\n**Work ethic and work-related skills** are more directly related to your actual job so it might be easier for you to see their value, but it doesn\u2019t mean that you should ignore all the previous points. These are the skills that make other people like working with you, and you have no idea how far this can go. \n\n* **Accountability**. Your ability to take responsibility at work is crucial. Understanding your tasks, correctly estimating how long they will take, and admitting your mistakes will influence not only your professional relationships but the productivity of the whole team as well.\n* **Time management** also relates closely to the personal productivity and efficiency of the team. You need to be able to consistently meet your deadlines. \n* **Networking**. I know, I know. We all hate networking. You might even never need this skill in the first place. But try to look at it from the diffraction perspective. Networking is an awesome opportunity to talk to people with the same interests but vastly different experiences. It\u2019s your chance to learn new things and meet cool people in your field. And you never know when these connections will come in handy.\n* **Presentation**. We\u2019ve already mentioned this in the previous points. You need to be able to talk about your ideas and experiences in a way that is engaging and easy to understand.\n\nIf you\u2019re still not convinced that soft skills are as important as hard skills, think about the word \u201cprofessional\u201d. What makes a person a professional? Yes, they know their job, but they also consistently meet their deadlines, offer great advice and help, masterfully present their ideas in front of the audience, and are generally well-liked. You won\u2019t\u2019 become a professional in your field without the hard skills, that\u2019s true, but when you have them more or less down, boosting your soft skills will open a lot more doors than you would expect.\n\n**BUT WHAT CAN I DO?**\n\n* **Ask for feedback from your friends and colleagues**. This is a good first step that will allow you to identify your strengths and weaknesses. You might be a naturally empathetic person, or a good listener or a charismatic speaker. Use this feedback (and some introspection) to locate your starting point. \n* **Search for online courses, videos, or articles**. Take a look at the [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/search?query=soft%20skills&amp;), [edX](https://www.edx.org/search?q=soft%20skills), or [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/courses/search/?src=ukw&amp;q=soft+skills) courses. Google some articles (for example, [Glassdoor blog](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/search/soft+skills/) has a lot of helpful advice) or read books on the topic ([How to Win Friends &amp; Influence People](https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034) by D.Carnegie is a famous classic).\n* **Find public talks, conferences, or meetups** that might interest you. First of all, you will enjoy learning something new. Second of all, you will get to meet people who are interested in the same things. You can also prepare some questions in advance and ask them after the speaker\u2019s presentation. \n* **Practice**. It is a pretty common concept that you can get better at talking to people only by actually talking to people. And it is true. Practice giving public speeches, volunteer to help your colleagues, ask your friends to help you prepare for the interview. For the introverted person (trust me, I get you) interacting with people might be difficult, but the more you do it, the easier it will get.\n\nAll in all, soft skills not only ease interactions with different people in your company (and outside of it) but also help highlight the hard skills that you already have. By investing the time in developing your soft skills and paying attention to how people around you communicate and work together productively, you will be able to improve the results of your work and set yourself up for success as a well-rounded developer.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Hyperskill", "subreddit_id": "t5_16kxt3", "subreddit_subscribers": 1681, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Java Marathon Day 11: Are soft skills important?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Hyperskill/comments/h10a2x/java_marathon_day_11_are_soft_skills_important/", "created": 1591885496.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "iMakeBaadChoices", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_gjiir", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1591485966, "domain": "self.learnprogramming", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/gy1c48/self_taught_programmer_wondering_what_to_learn/", "gildings": {}, "id": "gy1c48", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/learnprogramming/comments/gy1c48/self_taught_programmer_wondering_what_to_learn/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1591485967, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello! Quick backstory about me. I'm currently in my last year of college pursuing an honors bachelor of science doing a double major in statistics and psychology. All throughout high school I was learning to code. In my first and second year of college I took almost all the available CS courses. Through the summers I learned web dev (MEAN stack) using udemy/youtube and now I do freelance on the side.\n\nI'm about to graduate and I realized I want to go into software engineering but I feel like I don't know enough. Sure, I can make big web apps and I know how to program and about concepts like loops, scopes, variable types, etc, but that's about the extent of it. I've made big web apps for companies that seem huge, but at the end of the day it was all simple RESTful stuff. Reading &amp; writing to a database, taking info from forms, using EJS/React to display the info, etc. In my CS courses I learned OOP, design patterns, some algorithms and data structure stuff, but I've forgotten it all. I'm well off in the math department as a result of my stats degree but I feel like I'm behind in terms of fundamental CS stuff when comparing me to the people I'd be applying against. They've taken so many upper year courses that cover system design/architecture, how to build scaleable stuff, algos &amp; ds, whatever else.\n\n**So, as a guy who knows how to program but doesn't know anything past the knowledge of a first year, second year at most, what should I do? What should I focus on? What course should I take (preferably a free video series)?** I know most job interviews will ask leetcode style questions so I tried my hand at some. Most of the time I can get the brute force solution without a problem. However the optimal solution uses things like DFS, BFS, Hashtables and other advanced topics that I wouldn't even think to apply.\n\n**My Solution:** So the quick and dirty solution I had is just to take a data structure &amp; algorithms course. Probably [this Algorithms one](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) by Sedgewick on Coursera (if you know of a better course, please let me know!). This way, I'd get the necessary tools to solve typical interview problems, but even then I feel like I'm missing so much info that I should know.\n\nPS. The languages I know well are Python and JS (Node) but I have used Java, C#, C++ before but not enough to say that I \"know\" them.\n\ntldr: Check the bolded part above!\n\nThanks everyone!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "learnprogramming", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r7yd", "subreddit_subscribers": 1484538, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Self taught programmer wondering what to learn next to fill in the gaps", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/gy1c48/self_taught_programmer_wondering_what_to_learn/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1591485966.0}]
