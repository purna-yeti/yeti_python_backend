I realize HSK 1 is the very basic of the chinese language and passing it means almost NOTHING. Here, I just want to share how I learn and what resource(s) I use.\n\nBackground : I am Indonesian, My mother tongue is Bahasa Indonesia. Ten years ago, I had Chinese tuition for one year and then stopped because things seem so difficult. I never revised mandarin, so I forgot everything except maybe  \u4f60\u597d \n\nThis is how I learn:\n\n1. At the first few days, I drilled myself in pinyin table. A pinyin table by [yoyochinese.com](https://yoyochinese.com) is quite clear. The demonstrator uses english words so readers can easily relate how to pronounce things.\n2. Next, I use LingoDeer app and learn the very basic words such as \"How are you\" and stuff. I never force myself to remember the characters, but I have to pronounce them well..The good thing about it is, they demonstrate how to pronounce everything. The app is free for the first 4 lessons.\n3. I decided I did not want to pay, so I searched for other resources on the net but nothing seemed to be good....until I remember about [Coursera.org](https://Coursera.org). For those of you who didn't know, It's a website where you can learn courses from many universities. You can get a certification (after finishing a course), but you have to pay. If you don't want to pay any money, you may enjoy all the lessons and videos as long as you enroll to the course. \n4. I enrolled to [this](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mandarin-chinese-1) course by Shanghai Jiao Tong University. When I read about it, this university accepts students who are interested in learning mandarin by taking non-degree language program. When you enroll, you can watch 2 lecture videos each week (all taught by a professor), new words+pronounciation, quizzes, even per-chapter workbook if you are interested in mastering the writing. You may even ask in the forums as well.   \nIn my opinion, the professor here explains at slow pace thoroughly, and you get to understand the grammar and structure as well. SJTU provides 4 beginner level  and 4 intermediate level courses. By the end of eight courses, you can test yourself in HSK 3 (they claimed)\n5. After I reached a certain lesson, I decided to learn writing as well. So I printed out the workbook and practice the writing myself. Therefore, my writing is way behind my conversation and pinyin.\n6. As I am aiming to test myself in HSK 1, I also enrolled in [this](https://www.coursera.org/learn/hsk-1/home/welcome) course that specializes to prepare students to reach HSK 1. I assume this course was for those who already had the basics because videos and lessons aren't that explanative. The videos also seemed old for some reason. Here, they gave a thick pdf textbook of vocabs and conversation. I didn't really watch their videos as I only read their textbook.\n7. The most important thing is, I study every day. I might not have enough time on some days, so I would only rewatch some older episode's conversation so I don't forget. Sometimes it's only 10 minutes in a day but it's needed so my brain doesn't forget them. If I don't have time to open my laptop, coursera is also available as an app in android and ios. I always downloaded all the materials when I have wifi at home. I watch the videos on my phone even when I had no internet connection.\n\nThat's my tips. I hope the resources is useful for you who were looking for some free and good ones.

I didn't know why I didn't do this sooner! Complex concepts are broken down so well by Andrew Ng. However, it sort of jumps into the complex code a bit quick. Lots of courses tend to do this. It feels like a typical college course where you're taught the theory but not the execution.\n\n**Pros**:\n\n\\- Very well taught! Perhaps the best explanations of any course here.\n\n\\- Covers the key concepts of CNNs, Object Detection very well!\n\n\\- Covers mostly all the key CV topics\n\n**Cons**:\n\n\\- Not a big picture or big project type course, the code you do is more about understanding the principles rather than doing something impressive.\n\n\\- It's not a course that will teach u to do things, rather it's focused on understanding what you're doing.\n\n\\- Can be expensive since it's $49/mo but if you finish it within that month or even the 7/day trial it's an excellent value.\n\n**Score - 4.5/5**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Deep Learning and Computer Vision A-Z\u2122: OpenCV, SSD &amp; GANs](https://www.udemy.com/computer-vision-a-z/) \\-  Created by [Hadelin de Ponteves](https://www.udemy.com/computer-vision-a-z/#instructor-1), [Kirill Eremenko](https://www.udemy.com/computer-vision-a-z/#instructor-2), [SuperDataScience Team](https://www.udemy.com/computer-vision-a-z/#instructor-3)\n\n**Review** \\- **UPDATE**: I initially gave this course a relatively poor review, but I realized I had mistakenly confused some of the content with another [course](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-computer-vision/). This course was very good. The problem I had is that it's not good for actually learning Computer Vision core basics. You'll be able to do a few fun projects after, but it doesn't teach you principles and how to do a lot of this on your own custom projects. Overall though, it's well presented and taught well.\n\n**Pros**:\n\n\\- Good variety of core content\n\n\\- His code works (always a plus since libraries and packages get updated frequently)\n\n\\- Fun projects\n\n**Cons**:\n\n\\- Little core basics as it's more of a cookbook type course. Other courses are like this, but many teach the basics before moving onto a project.\n\n\\- Some fluff and overly long videos.

It's not a Deep Learning course though, at most he has a basic intro to using Keras, and how to implement CIFAR10 and MNIST, but those things are everywhere. The OpenCV and CV Basics are taught very well! And I like his voice and positivity. He's a good teacher and does it well.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n\\- Covers the basics of OpenCV well\n\n\\- All code works\n\n\\- Has a Deep Learning section for added value\n\n\\- The instructor is upbeat and easy to follow\n\n**Cons:**\n\n\\- The Deep Learning stuff is basic and pretty much fluff to boost the 'value' of this course. It's very basic and can be found elsewhere for free\n\n\\- It doesn't have that many cool projects to do\n\n**Score 4.3/5**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Deep Learning Computer Vision\u2122 CNN, OpenCV, YOLO, SSD &amp; GANs](https://www.udemy.com/master-deep-learning-computer-visiontm-cnn-ssd-yolo-gans/?couponCode=REDDIT) \\-  Created by [Rajeev Ratan](https://www.udemy.com/master-computer-vision-with-opencv-in-python/#instructor-1)\n\nI loved this course! It was my go-to reference for doing so many things. The content in this course is insane and he provides a full Virtual Machine with everything pre-installed (useful as all code works perfectly!). The explanations are very good. He doesn't always go into detail, but when he does it's taught quite well. The only issue I have is that I can see beginners sometimes being turned off since he rarely explains the code. He's more like \"here's the code that does this, this line this and this function was built to do this\". If you're a beginner it's understandable you'd be confused. However, the code, content, and number of projects were far more than the other courses, probably even put together (except for the PyImage course, but we'll get there). So to me, it's worth it. It covers all the details of Computer Vision rather than just pieces that look cool.\n\n**UPDATE**: Shortly after I posted the review I noticed Rajeev added some new content regarding using PaperSpace and deploying your CV model on AWS as an API (quite cool!)\n\n**Pros:**\n\n\\- Amazing and detailed content\n\n\\- Excellent theoretical explanations\n\n\\- Shows you how to get the best performance out of a CNN and built a variety of things\n\n\\- Very fun projects!\n\n\\- An enthusiastic teacher who you can tell has a passion for CV\n\n\\- New content always being added it seems!\n\n**Cons:**\n\n\\- Not for absolute beginners, now none of these courses are, but this one goes from easy to relatively hard quickly.\n\n\\- Instructor at times talks too fast and skims explanations of code\n\n\\- Some of the content is text, not video, so I didn't increase the score, but noted it regardless. Not really a con to be perfectly fair.\n\n**Score 4.6/5**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Computer Vision Intro\u2122 OpenCV4 in Python with Deep Learning](https://www.udemy.com/master-computer-vision-with-opencv-in-python/?couponCode=REDDIT) \\-  Created by [Rajeev Ratan](https://www.udemy.com/master-computer-vision-with-opencv-in-python/#instructor-1)\n\nThis is the older course of instructor above and it shows, it's been updated quite a bit, but some of the videos aren't the same as the code he provides. That isn't a deal breaker and he does mention it, but it sometimes does make you wonder if was a mistake or intentional. That said, all code is compatible with OpenCV4 which is awesome. Also, the number of projects makes it quite a nice course to get some good practical OpenCV knowledge. A Virtual Machine is also provided (nice touch!). This course has some excellent OpenCV tutorials, fun projects and there is some added Deep Learning stuff so it's quite cool, not as much fluff and good explanations again.\n\n**UPDATE**: Shortly after I posted the review I noticed Rajeev added some new content such as using Caffee models in OpenCV to colorize black and white images and some other object detection stuff, really cool projects but not explained in too much depth, still cool regardless!\n\n**Pros:**\n\n\\- Easy to follow and I feel more of the OpenCV basics were thought\n\n\\- All code works and explanations are on point!\n\n\\- Bonus Deep Learning stuff\n\n\\- Fun Projects\n\n\\- Enthusiast Lecturer\n\n**Cons:**\n\n\\- Audio bad at some times (not much, maybe like 20 mins appears to have been recorded with his laptop mic vs external mic)\n\n\\- The code in the videos is not always the same as the downloadable code he provides\n\n**Score - 4.3/5**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Deep Learning: Advanced Computer Vision (Udemy)](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-computer-vision/?couponCode=REDDITCV)  \\- Created by  [Lazy Programmer Inc.](https://www.udemy.com/user/lazy-programmer/)\n\n**UPDATE**: I went back to this course and realized I might have unfairly slammed it. If you want exactly what's offered (look at the syllabus, it's taught really well). But as a standalone CV course, it's lacking.\n\nI enjoyed this course, it doesn't cover very much but it does some of the basics fairly well. What I liked was that it moved relatively slow and spent a while on some details. It goes into good detail about implementing and building the CNN's he teaches. Overall, good course, just not as much wide content as some of the others but still good at what it does!\n\n**Pros:**\n\n\\- Covers a few topics, but covers them well\n\n\\- If you like code-along courses this is for you\n\n\\- Explains Neural Style Transfers and VGG well\n\n**Cons:**\n\n\\- He doesn't step outside a few things, but the things he teaches are taught very well too! So it's not a real con per se\n\n\\- Code along courses are good, but tend to waste a lot of time for me.

Absolute perfect and monster of a course! Now it's expensive compared to the others, but this course teaches almost everything you'll need. I wish the ImageNet Bundle was included at this price, but that module is over $600. This course covers all key areas of Deep Learning in Computer Vision. It does not have any OpenCV (well some, but PIL or imultils are used more often). The videos aren't detailed, you're paying for the detailed textbooks, the videos are pretty much overviews of each chapter. So, yes the course material and code is where the value is, and it's excellent in quality!\n\nThe code isn't always super easy to follow, but he explains almost every line in the book so it's not a complaint, just stating that this isn't a course that's going to be easily accessible to begineers. Also, like some of the others above, it comes with a Virtual Machine with all packages pre-installed.\n\n**UPDATE**: I initially rated the value of this course as 3.5/5 but I'm bumping it 4.1. Adrian and his community will offer to very good help to your research projects etc. So if you're stuck on need advice, it's valuable. Rajeev and Jose will often offer similar support in their Udemy forums, but Adrian's depth and expertise shines if the problem is particularly hard or grounding breaking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Pros:**\n\n\\- Probably the best resources for Practical Deep Learning Computer Vision online\n\n\\- Excellent explanations by a very experienced and passionate teacher\n\n\\- All code is explained nicely\n\n\\- Because of his experience, you know he covers the most relevant and important topics\n\n**Cons:**\n\n\\- Not for beginners, obviously, but it should be noted if you're a beginner you will feel overwhelmed going into this course\n\n\\- Explanations on video are mostly fluff, he doesn't really teach. It's more of an overview of what's covered in the book (which is the real meat of the course)\n\n\\- Expensive!\n\n**Score - 4.5/5**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven though I initially rated Rajeev's Udemy course the highest, it's only because of the insanely cheap price of $10. It's a great course and I keep coming back to it a lot. That said, when it goes up against Adrian's $300. It can't compete with the detail and explanations offered in Adrian's text. And I don't know how I missed Andrew Ng's Coursera's course, but the theory explanations in that course are best out all so far (Rajeev and Adrian do an excellent job too).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**NOTE**: I got around to reviewing Adrian's other bundles. I have a friend who purchased the ImageNet Bundle and he lent me the printed text (which has been updated since). But I don't have access to the videos. Here's a quick summary of the PyImage 3 Bundles\n\n* STARTER BUNDLE - Very good value and an excellent resource. Covers all the basics in detail but doesn't get into more advanced and cooler areas of computer vision such as Object Detection and advanced CNNs.\n* PRACTITIONER BUNDLE - Highly recommend you purchase this instead of the Starter Bundle. It's excellent and covers pretty much everything you'd need to know in Computer Vision Deep Learning\n* ImageNet Bundle - It's excellent, but to me not really worth double the price of the Practitioner Bundle. It does have some nice projects and some advanced stuff. I was impressed nevertheless, but in terms of actual theory and knowledge, it's not much new content when compared to Practitioner Bundle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn summary, I'll put it like this. For a $10 Udemy course, Rajeev's course will take you from beginner to a working professional. But to be an expert, you'll need Adrian's (of PyImage) course. Andrew Ng's course will ensure you're understanding key concepts right, it's brilliant in breaking down the theory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeel free to ask me any questions on the above courses.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "datascience", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "subreddit_subscribers": 133797, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A review of PyImage and other Computer Vision courses", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564160229, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/chqd6r/a_review_of_pyimage_and_other_computer_vision/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1564073840.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "careertroubleguy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_12pbj8", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564005419, "domain": "self.Python", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/cheopq/reviews_of_8_python_deep_learning_computer_vision/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cheopq", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/Python/comments/cheopq/reviews_of_8_python_deep_learning_computer_vision/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1564005420, "score": 7, "selftext": "Hi All,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust a quick update to my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/b97hdk/a_review_of_5_python_deep_learning_computer/) where I started reviewing Computer Vision courses.

Not bad for beginners though, especially if you're looking to learn PyTorch.\n\n**Pros**:\n\n\\- Very well taught\n\n\\- Basics covered well, lots of time spent on Neural Nets and CNNs\n\n\\- Transfer Learning is well taught\n\n\\- Teaches PyTorch very well\n\n**Cons**:\n\n\\- Only covers the basics and doesn't go into more advanced territory\n\n\\- Lacks cool projects\n\n**Score - 4.2/5**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Computer Vision - Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/convolutional-neural-networks/computer-vision-Ob1nR) \\- by Andrew Ng\n\n**Review** \\- Excellent Course! I didn't know why I didn't do this sooner! Complex concepts are broken down so well by Andrew Ng. However, it sort of jumps into the complex code a bit quick. Lots of courses tend to do this. It feels like a typical college course where you're taught the theory but not the execution.\n\n**Pros**:\n\n\\- Very well taught! Perhaps the best explanations of any course here.\n\n\\- Covers the key concepts of CNNs, Object Detection very well!\n\n\\- Covers mostly all the key CV topics\n\n**Cons**:\n\n\\- Not a big picture or big project type course, the code you do is more about understanding the principles rather than doing something impressive.\n\n\\- It's not a course that will teach u to do things, rather it's focused on understanding what you're doing.\n\n\\- Can be expensive since it's $49/mo but if you finish it within that month or even the 7/day trial it's an excellent value.\n\n**Score - 4.5/5**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Deep Learning and Computer Vision A-Z\u2122: OpenCV, SSD &amp; GANs](https://www.udemy.com/computer-vision-a-z/) \\-  Created by [Hadelin de Ponteves](https://www.udemy.com/computer-vision-a-z/#instructor-1), [Kirill Eremenko](https://www.udemy.com/computer-vision-a-z/#instructor-2), [SuperDataScience Team](https://www.udemy.com/computer-vision-a-z/#instructor-3)\n\n**Review** \\- **UPDATE**: I initially gave this course a relatively poor review, but I realized I had mistakenly confused some of the content with another [course](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-computer-vision/). This course was very good. The problem I had is that it's not good for actually learning Computer Vision core basics. You'll be able to do a few fun projects after, but it doesn't teach you principles and how to do a lot of this on your own custom projects. Overall though, it's well presented and taught well.\n\n**Pros**:\n\n\\- Good variety of core content\n\n\\- His code works (always a plus since libraries and packages get updated frequently)\n\n\\- Fun projects\n\n**Cons**:\n\n\\- Little core basics as it's more of a cookbook type course. Other courses are like this, but many teach the basics before moving onto a project.\n\n\\- Some fluff and overly long videos. A bit inconsistent in what's taught well and what's skimmed.\n\n**Score - 4.2/5**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Python for Computer Vision with OpenCV and Deep Learning](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-computer-vision-with-opencv-and-deep-learning/) \\-  Created by [Jose Portilla](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-computer-vision-with-opencv-and-deep-learning/#instructor-1)\n\nI enjoyed this course quite a bit. It's not a Deep Learning course though, at most he has a basic intro to using Keras, and how to implement CIFAR10 and MNIST, but those things are everywhere. The OpenCV and CV Basics are taught very well! And I like his voice and positivity. He's a good teacher and does it well.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n\\- Covers the basics of OpenCV well\n\n\\- All code works\n\n\\- Has a Deep Learning section for added value\n\n\\- The instructor is upbeat and easy to follow\n\n**Cons:**\n\n\\- The Deep Learning stuff is basic and pretty much fluff to boost the 'value' of this course. It's very basic and can be found elsewhere for free\n\n\\- It doesn't have that many cool projects to do\n\n**Score 4.3/5**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Deep Learning Computer Vision\u2122 CNN, OpenCV, YOLO, SSD &amp; GANs](https://www.udemy.com/master-deep-learning-computer-visiontm-cnn-ssd-yolo-gans/?couponCode=REDDIT) \\-  Created by [Rajeev Ratan](https://www.udemy.com/master-computer-vision-with-opencv-in-python/#instructor-1)\n\nI loved this course! It was my go-to reference for doing so many things. The content in this course is insane and he provides a full Virtual Machine with everything pre-installed (useful as all code works perfectly!). The explanations are very good. He doesn't always go into detail, but when he does it's taught quite well. The only issue I have is that I can see beginners sometimes being turned off since he rarely explains the code. He's more like \"here's the code that does this, this line this and this function was built to do this\". If you're a beginner it's understandable you'd be confused. However, the code, content, and number of projects were far more than the other courses, probably even put together (except for the PyImage course, but we'll get there). So to me, it's worth it. It covers all the details of Computer Vision rather than just pieces that look cool.\n\n**UPDATE**: Shortly after I posted the review I noticed Rajeev added some new content regarding using PaperSpace and deploying your CV model on AWS as an API (quite cool!)\n\n**Pros:**\n\n\\- Amazing and detailed content\n\n\\- Excellent theoretical explanations\n\n\\- Shows you how to get the best performance out of a CNN and built a variety of things\n\n\\- Very fun projects!\n\n\\- An enthusiastic teacher who you can tell has a passion for CV\n\n\\- New content always being added it seems!\n\n**Cons:**\n\n\\- Not for absolute beginners, now none of these courses are, but this one goes from easy to relatively hard quickly.\n\n\\- Instructor at times talks too fast and skims explanations of code\n\n\\- Some of the content is text, not video, so I didn't increase the score, but noted it regardless. Not really a con to be perfectly fair.\n\n**Score 4.6/5**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Computer Vision Intro\u2122 OpenCV4 in Python with Deep Learning](https://www.udemy.com/master-computer-vision-with-opencv-in-python/?couponCode=REDDIT) \\-  Created by [Rajeev Ratan](https://www.udemy.com/master-computer-vision-with-opencv-in-python/#instructor-1)\n\nThis is the older course of instructor above and it shows, it's been updated quite a bit, but some of the videos aren't the same as the code he provides. That isn't a deal breaker and he does mention it, but it sometimes does make you wonder if was a mistake or intentional. That said, all code is compatible with OpenCV4 which is awesome. Also, the number of projects makes it quite a nice course to get some good practical OpenCV knowledge. A Virtual Machine is also provided (nice touch!). This course has some excellent OpenCV tutorials, fun projects and there is some added Deep Learning stuff so it's quite cool, not as much fluff and good explanations again.\n\n**UPDATE**: Shortly after I posted the review I noticed Rajeev added some new content such as using Caffee models in OpenCV to colorize black and white images and some other object detection stuff, really cool projects but not explained in too much depth, still cool regardless!\n\n**Pros:**\n\n\\- Easy to follow and I feel more of the OpenCV basics were thought\n\n\\- All code works and explanations are on point!\n\n\\- Bonus Deep Learning stuff\n\n\\- Fun Projects\n\n\\- Enthusiast Lecturer\n\n**Cons:**\n\n\\- Audio bad at some times (not much, maybe like 20 mins appears to have been recorded with his laptop mic vs external mic)\n\n\\- The code in the videos is not always the same as the downloadable code he provides\n\n**Score - 4.3/5**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Deep Learning: Advanced Computer Vision (Udemy)](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-computer-vision/?couponCode=REDDITCV)  \\- Created by  [Lazy Programmer Inc.](https://www.udemy.com/user/lazy-programmer/)\n\n**UPDATE**: I went back to this course and realized I might have unfairly slammed it. If you want exactly what's offered (look at the syllabus, it's taught really well). But as a standalone CV course, it's lacking.\n\nI enjoyed this course, it doesn't cover very much but it does some of the basics fairly well. What I liked was that it moved relatively slow and spent a while on some details. It goes into good detail about implementing and building the CNN's he teaches. Overall, good course, just not as much wide content as some of the others but still good at what it does!\n\n**Pros:**\n\n\\- Covers a few topics, but covers them well\n\n\\- If you like code-along courses this is for you\n\n\\- Explains Neural Style Transfers and VGG well\n\n**Cons:**\n\n\\- He doesn't step outside a few things, but the things he teaches are taught very well too! So it's not a real con per se\n\n\\- Code along courses are good, but tend to waste a lot of time for me. I get why many people like it, but to me, it slows me down (could just be my impatience)\n\n\\- It lacks a wide variety of projects\n\n**Score - 4.3/5**\n\n**NOTE**: The lazyprogrammer has a second course that seems quite good on GANs and Variational Autoencoders\n\n[https://www.udemy.com/deep-learning-gans-and-variational-autoencoders/?couponCode=REDDITCV](https://www.udemy.com/deep-learning-gans-and-variational-autoencoders/?couponCode=REDDITCV)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Deep Learning for Computer Vision with Python - Practitioner Bundle](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/deep-learning-computer-vision-python-book/) \\- Created by [Adrian Rosebrock](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/author/adrian/)\n\n(**NOTE** Adrian provided a 10% Coupon:  **reddit**)\n\nThis is the mother load. Absolute perfect and monster of a course! Now it's expensive compared to the others, but this course teaches almost everything you'll need. I wish the ImageNet Bundle was included at this price, but that module is over $600. This course covers all key areas of Deep Learning in Computer Vision. It does not have any OpenCV (well some, but PIL or imultils are used more often). The videos aren't detailed, you're paying for the detailed textbooks, the videos are pretty much overviews of each chapter. So, yes the course material and code is where the value is, and it's excellent in quality!\n\nThe code isn't always super easy to follow, but he explains almost every line in the book so it's not a complaint, just stating that this isn't a course that's going to be easily accessible to begineers. Also, like some of the others above, it comes with a Virtual Machine with all packages pre-installed.\n\n**UPDATE**: I initially rated the value of this course as 3.5/5 but I'm bumping it 4.1. Adrian and his community will offer to very good help to your research projects etc. So if you're stuck on need advice, it's valuable. Rajeev and Jose will often offer similar support in their Udemy forums, but Adrian's depth and expertise shines if the problem is particularly hard or grounding breaking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Pros:**\n\n\\- Probably the best resources for Practical Deep Learning Computer Vision online\n\n\\- Excellent explanations by a very experienced and passionate teacher\n\n\\- All code is explained nicely\n\n\\- Because of his experience, you know he covers the most relevant and important topics\n\n**Cons:**\n\n\\- Not for beginners, obviously, but it should be noted if you're a beginner you will feel overwhelmed going into this course\n\n\\- Explanations on video are mostly fluff, he doesn't really teach. It's more of an overview of what's covered in the book (which is the real meat of the course)\n\n\\- Expensive!\n\n**Score - 4.5/5**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven though I initially rated Rajeev's Udemy course the highest, it's only because of the insanely cheap price of $10. It's a great course and I keep coming back to it a lot. That said, when it goes up against Adrian's $300. It can't compete with the detail and explanations offered in Adrian's text.

One of the success stories of being an excellent machine learning expert is to be proactive to work in a team, assimilate their ideas and put your thoughts into action. So, it\u2019s necessary that you be a good team player.\n\n**4. Gain a Good Grounding in Data Analysis**\n\nData is the new oil for any industry or technological segment. Hence, [data analysts](https://www.tapresume.co.in/analysts-jobs) are the most suited professionals to make a perfect transition into a machine learning career as their next best career move. Of course, if you are not a data analyst, you need not worry; develop an analytical mindset and set your focus on data analysis and interpretation. This means you need to play with the data \u2013 dig the data, comprehend where it is most suited and infer the net outcomes from the data. Bottom line is you need to share the information in a prudent way, generate good visualization, and integrate information that can be easily understood by all stakeholders.\n\n**5. Learn the Right Programming Language to Get Started**\n\nThe best programming language that is most suited for machine learning is [Python](https://www.tapresume.co.in/python-jobs). Apart from that, you also need to learn how to use machine learning libraries. If you feel daunted about how to get started, there are a host of institutes and courses online that teaches you the concepts of Python, apart from customized courses dedicated only for machine learning. It\u2019s always better to connect with the experts to get going in this area.\n\n**6. Online Courses can Help you a Great Extent**\n\nAs mentioned in my earlier tip, you can take up some online courses, apart from participating in learning competitions (kaggle.com is one such website) to gain good knowledge and showcase it to others. There are several online customized courses offered by learning platforms such as [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), which are dedicated only for machine learning. Hence, enroll in some good online course, read new articles on emerging technologies and connect with technology experts on various social media platforms to trigger a career push in machine learning.\n\n**7. Research about the Industry where you want to Work**\n\nYou need to understand that every organization has specific and unique goals. Hence, it is better to do thorough research about the industry, where you want to work. For instance, it may take a couple of months to understand a financial product of a specific business segment, but the crux is to research and learn about it as quickly as possible to leverage your knowledge in this domain. Also, remember that you need not be an expert, but gaining some preliminary knowledge about the domain or the product that you are going to work really goes a long way in building a good career in machine learning.\n\n**8. Look for Small Companies**\n\nIf you are interested to begin your career in machine learning, it\u2019s always advisable to start small. Hence, don\u2019t target big companies such as Amazon, Google, etc as they look for experienced candidates. Try to target startup companies, where you have immense opportunities to learn and apply your knowledge.\n\n**9. Showcase Some toy Projects**\n\nOne aspect which helps a potential employer to take note of your skill sets is to showcase some good projects. Take the advice of your seniors; connect with experts and try creating and uploading a project in Github. This way, you could definitely gain an edge over other potential candidates, eying a career in machine learning.\n\n**Piece of Advice**\n\nSimilar to any other career option, you need to have the passion, interest to try new things and above all the genuine aptitude of learning to make a mark in machine learning. Keeping aside the technical and analytical skills, you need to get motivated about solving new challenges, day in and day out and always proactive to learn new technologies to keep yourself updated.

It is no joke! When people say they thought they failed, they\u2019re not kidding. I was confident on MAYBE 10 questions. Kind of sure MAYBE 20 questions. Staring at the screen about ready to cry like an infant because I have no clue, all the rest of them.\n\nI was able to strike a nice conversation with the proctor before the test. She came and got me when I raised my sad little hand at 100. I gave her the universal thumbs down sign for, \u201cWell, screwed that one up\u201d. She tried to support me by telling me that Adaptive Tests are like that. The harder they felt the better I probably did. I thought that was nice of her and all, but I knew I bombed it. I was hoping to go beyond 100 so that I knew I had a fighting chance. But nope, ended at 100.\n\nSo I get the print out waiting to see what Domains I bombed the worst on and I couldn\u2019t believe it. \\*\\*\\*\u201dCongratulations\u201d\\*\\*\\* Like what&gt;&gt;&gt;? How, did I get someone else\u2019s report? Nope it had my picture. Holy cow!\n\nOk, So I\u2019m going to do the normal list of things I used and how I used them. I also will indicate where I think I would have spent a lot more time if I failed. Of course I can only say to much so I don\u2019t break my NDA before I\u2019m even a CISSP.\n\n\u201cA long time ago in a galaxy far, far away\u2026.\u201d\n\nHave 20 years in this IT thing. First half mostly in IBM Midrange systems. System36, AS/400 and iSeries. Most of that time as an SA but moving into architecture for the a while. Then the last half of the time spent about 6 years in Wintel, VMware admin / team lead then the last 4 as a Manager of a UNIX team. Pretty much no straight security experience other than what we are exposed to as SA\u2019s.\n\nAbout a year ago I started thinking that I really needed a mid career skills refresh. For some reason the CISSP stuck out to me as the next thing I really wanted to have a grasp of and pass. So off I went. Went to Dr. Google and started researching. Watched the Mike Chappel LinedIn (Lynda) series pretty quickly and went and purchased his book. Didn\u2019t really work too hard at it until about 3 months ago when I got a job scare. Thankfully I made it through the job scare but it forced me to get off my rear end and start moving. \n\nThe last three months have really added up to a lot of hours.\n\nUsually 2 to 4 hours during the weekdays and 5 to 8 hours per weekend day. Then the last few weeks it\u2019s been all out. 6 hours a day during the weekdays and 10+ hours a day on weekends for the last 2 weeks. \n\nI felt pretty strong going into the exam. First couple of questions were not to hard. I second guessed my self but felt ok. Then it got real. As I stated up above. Thought I was crashing and burning halfway through. Several questions I was sticking on for too long so just made an educated guess and clicked Next so that I could stay withing my time allotment if I needed to go to 150\u2026\n\nWhen I got to around 80, I almost chuckled to myself. I actually started thinking how I would write my \\*I failed\\* /r post. Still worked hard at every question but pretty much was just getting myself to 100 so it can fail me and I could leave. At best I was hoping for question 101 so that I could feel like I had a chance. But nope, it got to 100. Paused for a few seconds and said I was done. I raised my hand in defeat. Left and after talking with the room monitor for a minute, went up front and got my paper. Contained on the page was the wonderful \u201cCongratulations\u201d\u2026\n\nBefore I go into what I used, let me say without breaking NDA what I wish I had known more. I would have really rocked the policy steps a lot more than I did. I thought I knew them, but the test really crushed how little I really did learn them. I could speak to them at high levels but not really in great detail. That was a mistake. If I had to take this exam again, that is an area that I absolutely would spend a lot more time on. You can not fake it. Go to bars and talk to strangers about Security Policies. They will think your weird, but until you can talk in regular conversation about them, you probably don\u2019t know them well enough.\n\nOk, so now the \u201cWhat did I use\u201d list\n\nPretty much everything you hear here all the time.\n\nFirst 9 months just watched LinkedIn\u2019s Mike Chappel CISSP video\u2019s\n\nLast 3 months\n\nRead the entire Mike Chappel CISSP book. Yes cover to cover.\n\nThen found this subreddit (Couldn\u2019t have passed without it. seriously). The information and motivation were outstanding.\n\nWatched Kelly H\u2019s. Cybrary videos\n\nRead Eric Conrad\u2019s CISSP Study Guide book Cover to Cover\n\nRead Erics Conrads 11th Hour Cover to Cover. \n\nWatched Chappel\u2019s videos again.\n\nRead Chappel\u2019s book again cover to cover but this time took notes and highlighted.\n\nWatched Kelly H\u2019s video\u2019s again.\n\nTook every practice exam from the ISC2 book there was. Made notes on everything I missed.\n\nRead Eric\u2019s CISSP book again cover to cover and made notes, took practice questions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout 2 weeks out I started the Boson exams. Would take one exam at a time with 2 days in between to review the questions I missed. I printed every one I missed so that I could review on the screen and then review later. Scored mostly in the low 70\u2019s . 2 days before test I took last one and scored low 80\u2019s. Saturday and Sunday I went into full review mode. Just quickly going through everything looking for gaps in knowledge.\n\nAlso about a week ago, I stumbled onto another video series from Kelly H. which was a recording from one of her live sessions. About the same length as the main Cybrary series. This one is also on Cybrary.\n\nShe has mostly the same stories and jokes but it was just good to reinforce the brain over and over again. \n\nLast night I went through the mindmaps for CISSP. Wish I found them earlier. Read Sunflower this morning before going to the gym for a quick run to get blood to the brain. Not a primary source but found it helpful.\n\nTook the test. Thought I failed, but I passed \ud83d\ude0a\n\nLastly, if I can make one recommendation that I think helped me. Take the online class \u201cLearning how to Learn\u201d. It\u2019s about 3 hours of content if I recall correctly. It talked about the neuroscience about how the brain actually learns at a physical level. It really was an eye opener on how to chunk the data into smaller bites. Making sure to take little 5 minute breaks every 50 minutes or so. How and when to review the information to try and move the data from working to short term to long term memory. This was a massive help. \n\n[https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)\n\nHere is the link to the mind maps. \n\n[http://www.mindcert.com/category/mind-maps/cissp/](http://www.mindcert.com/category/mind-maps/cissp/)\n\nI can\u2019t really rate anything on a scale. I think everything provided a different voice that helped me retain over time the information. The one thing I printed but didn\u2019t use was the Process Manual 2.0 from madunix. That was a mistake. That would have probably helped me learn the processes in more detail than I felt I had while taking the test. \n\nBut can\u2019t complain too much. A pass at 100 is the best I could hope for. Lot of work to get here but the job is done. Now onto certification and looking for my next challenge.,\n\nThanks you to this community. Was a massive help. If you haven\u2019t taken your exam yet, good luck and get your hours in. The exam will test your ability to answer questions you haven\u2019t really seen before by inferencing a deep understanding of what you have.

So first off let me just say I'm a statistics major that's going into their final year. I've taken all calc's, linear algebra's, intro to stats, probability, regression, etc.\n\nSo I've been wanting to get into ML and I know Andrew Ng's ML course is considered the holy grail so I started it. It's been around a week or two and content wise I'm on week 6. I watch the lectures at 2x speed and finish the assignment in Python for each week in like a day or so. Some of the things I learn are new (like the concepts themselves, ie. Gradient descent, Cost functions, NNs, etc) but since I'm so used to working with matrices and math in general, it's not too bad for me.\n\nHowever at this point I'm getting a little bored. It honestly feels like a stats class for me and I'm at the part where we discuss bias-variance and even though I feel like I've learned a good amount of machine learning, it still feels like I don't know how to apply it to anything at all. Like if I were to do a Kaggle competition right now I would get nowhere.\n\nSo I want to switch gears for a bit and do a more applied course. The ML course I know is great and I have around 4 or 6 more weeks to go and I'll get to it eventually, but I really just want to dive into the more applied side of things for now. Like apply the knowledge of what I've learned of NNs into different datasets, etc. Like one goal I have is to implement the NEAT algorithm to a simple game.\n\nAnyway, what do you guys recommend?
