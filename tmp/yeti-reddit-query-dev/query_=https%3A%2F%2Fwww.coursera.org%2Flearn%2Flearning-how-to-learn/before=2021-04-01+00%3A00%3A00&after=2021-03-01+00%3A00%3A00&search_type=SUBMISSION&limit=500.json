Part of it was curiosity. The other part was hoping it could help me go somewhere. That latter part got me a lot of not-so-nice laughs. To quote one person, I may as well tell people [I learned from the back of a cereal box](https://www.freecodecamp.org). I did it for a while anyway, but the interest ultimately died because it felt like a waste of time (no, I didn't hate it).\n\nNow, I'm saving up money to return to school (for the third time!), but I don't have my mind made up on what degree I want (nor did I the first time I went; that was only out of family pressure), so I considered looking into [some things on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-support) in the meantime to give me an idea. Turns out those are really only good for wanting to tell your boss at current job you learned something new.

Is it any better? I don't know. I grouped my recommendations based on different personas.\n\n*The prerequisite for any of the recommendations is that you feel comfortable using Python. If not, you should take a basic Python course first.*\n\n# You're interested in the field, maybe took some course related to ML, but generally, you know very little and wonder where to start.\n\n1. Personally,  I'm not a fan of the trainer's attitude but still, start from this course: [https://course.fast.ai/](https://course.fast.ai/)\n\nAt this point, you really shouldn't focus too much on deep learning frameworks, what is worth learning in 2021, what are trends on the job market, etc.\n\nAfter the course, you should have tried the most popular problems in ML and have a good grasp of what are the modern tools,  the challenges, how things evolved over years, and what to do next.\n\n# You already had your head around and want to relearn the basics with a much better theoretical understanding.\n\n1.

Take all the courses in this specialization: [https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning)\n5. Take all the courses from Andrew Ng's Deep Learning specialization: [https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)\n6. Take this course: [https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus)\n7. This one is NLP focused, but I recommend it: [http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/)\n\nProbably you'll need to take those courses multiple times. I tried to order them so it's easier to build the understanding of the material gradually, but in the reality, you'll probably have to stop at some moment, go to another course, suddenly something will click in your head and you'll understand things from the previous course, etc. Don't expect to take one course and remember and understand everything immediately.\n\nBut once you get all the concepts and build a good intuition everything will become much clearer and you'll learn new things faster.\n\n# You have a strong mathematical background, understand how networks work and can solve common problems, but you want to specialize in a computer vision domain.\n\n1.  Take this course: [https://www.pyimagesearch.com/pyimagesearch-gurus/](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/pyimagesearch-gurus/) It isn't free though.\n2. Take this course: [https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-computer-vision--ud810](https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-computer-vision--ud810)\n\nAfter taking those courses you should feel quite confident in tackling different computer vision problems either with ML or \"classical\" approaches.\n\n# You already have strong theoretical foundations, finished some small ML projects on your own, and want to apply for the ML engineer position.\n\nNote: there are no official definitions, sometimes companies are looking for data analysts, data engineers, MLOps, etc., and refer to all of them as ML engineers. Read job postings carefully.\n\n1. Take this course on data structures with Python: [https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html)\n2. Take some additional courses on Python if you don't feel comfortable with programming in environments other than Jupyter notebook. I recommend Pluralsight platform.\n3.

At the same time, if you're dreaming about a position at DeepMind, self-study maybe not enough.\n\n**The best thing is that after getting familiar with materials from this list, somewhere in the middle you should be more than capable of steering your study in directions that are the most beneficial in your individual case.** \n\nMe, I still use these materials at work, rewatch youtube videos, practice Math, and constantly take new courses.

In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. \n\nMany researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI.  \n\n\nThis course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "FreeClasses", "subreddit_id": "t5_2guqo7", "subreddit_subscribers": 4, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Machine Learning from Stanford University", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeClasses/comments/m054ds/machine_learning_from_stanford_university/", "created": 1615168535.0}]
