I have a big clunky desktop with like 18 USB ports and zero experience plugging things into ipads with their weird proprietary ports and adapters so you may have to do your own research on that.      \n.     \n.     \n\nalright, so as someone who's personally experienced the rookie pitfalls to this synth daw stuff, you now have ~~two~~ three things to learn how to do, that are kind of at odds with each other.\n\n1. learn how to program your own synth patches     \n\n2. learn how to produce completed tracks\n\nand actually also      \n\n----3.  learn how to write songs that don't suck    \n\nif you try to start out trying to learn all three things at the same time, you will get completely overwhelmed, you will never finish a track.  you will never. finish one.  your desktop will be littered with files named \"shittysongassCOPY.proj\" that are just little 2 bar loops you made when you were stoned.  you will spend all your time twiddling knobs and dicking around and getting burnt out and going and watching netflix instead.\n\nso what order should you learn them in.  you won't like this answer, but I almost want to say 2, 3, then 1.  so it would be:\n\n2. learn how to produce completed tracks     \n\n3.  learn how to write songs that don't suck     \n\n1. learn how to program your own synth patches\n\n\n\nyou ultimately want to make cool songs, right?  well trust me, your notes you choose and your chord progressions, the actual NOTES that make up your song can achieve so much more than a nifty sounding patch or synth texture ever can.  I hear so many electronic musicians who have amazing sound design skills, but trash songwriting, and their music gets boring for me fast because there's not enough to chew on.  on the flipside, I enjoy listening to a lot of [well-written songs made with terrible equipment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFiLErZJT2s) or [terrible recording quality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfzTdOWr8BU).  you can always worry about your sound design and effects later.\n\n**1.**  so the easiest way to start learning a DAW, getting used to its workflow, is to make **cover songs** with it.  take songs you already know, they can either be stuff by your favorite band or a well-known classic rock song on the radio all the time, whatever, the important thing is that you can recite the entire thing in your head from memory, because you'll be recreating it.\n\nload up some quick presets in your daw, generally at least 4 tracks: drums, bass, chords, and lead(vocal).  but you can get away with only the first three, and forget the lead for now.  choose drums that are generic and can be used for whatever genre, same with the other instruments/patches on the other tracks.  I'd recommend an electric bass, and as for the chords idk, depends on the genre, you can do piano, synth pad, acoustic guitar, flutes, whatever as long as its texture is more subdued and can play full chords without it overwhelming the other parts.\n\nyou can create patterns/sections in one of two ways.  you can click the notes in by hand on the \"piano roll\", and manually sequence everything, or you can play them live and record them.  I tend to find the latter more fun to do, at least if it's something I can physically play.  I find that I make more timing mistakes if I try to sequence something in the grid.  If your timing isn't 100% perfect, you can slow down the song's tempo, record the part, and then speed the tempo back up to normal.  I'm also sure garageband has a \"quantization\" function that automatically sets your notes on the beat.\n\nrecord the different sections of the song, chain them all together, maybe have a little fun playing the lead vocal yourself by hand on your 4th track as your \"backing track\" plays behind you.  it's great fun, and it helps you with a few things: learning your daw, and developing your musical ear.\n\nafter making a bunch of cover songs, you will start to internalize how songs are written, how they are structured, etc, which will make it easier for you to write your own songs later.\n\n**2.**  so for learning topic #2, learning songwriting, uh I would go on youtube and learn what a song's \"key\" (aka \"scale\") is, how a song's different chords are born from that key, the emotional effects of different movements from chord to chord within that key, when you can change key (also called \"key modulation), etc.\n\nunfortunately songwriting is a big vague topic and the research is still very much ongoing lol.  but at least get down some basic music theory, learn what a \"Major 7th\" chord is and all that good stuff, etc.\n\n**edit:** here's a great book on learning music theory, the first 6 chapters are free on their website, if you want a full copy PM me.     \nhttps://www.howmusicreallyworks.com/Pages_Introduction/Introduction.html\n\n**3.** and finally we get to what you actually wanted to do, which is program synth sounds.  the website BeatPort used to have this amazing article series for teaching synth programming but those fucks have since deleted it.  I don't really know any great tutorial series anymore.\n\nhere's a video that's lame as hell featuring background music that nobody could fuck to but is still a great into to all the parts of a synth and what they do:     \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMF8F9z7Zr8    \n\nand then after that I would make a coursera account and \"enroll\" in this free online course, just to watch the video lessons and follow along.  it will teach you a lot of advanced synth programming techniques\n\nhttps://www.coursera.org/learn/music-synthesizer", "created_utc": 1568557723, "gildings": {}, "id": "f0drg6y", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_d3r5h7", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_f0cfh15", "permalink": "/r/synthesizers/comments/d3r5h7/what_should_my_first_synth_be/f0drg6y/", "retrieved_on": 1568557734, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "synthesizers", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rdyc", "total_awards_received": 0, "created": 1568557723.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "hellowings", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_rctve", "author_patreon_flair": false, "body": "[This 2-page PDF](http://www.math.toronto.edu/nhoell/10rules-of-studying.pdf) (10 rules of good studying; 10 rules of bad studying) from the extremely popular (and free) Coursera course, [Learning How To Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn), provides pretty cool strategies for making your studying more playful &amp; more effective, and they are science-based (in the course itself the lecturers provide the links to the research studies).\n\nThere is also a somewhat different version for kids &amp; teens ([this 2-page PDF](https://barbaraoakley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-Top-Ideas-to-Help-Your-Learning-and-10-Pitfalls-1.pdf)), from the more recent book by the author. \n\nAnd the thing you are talking about in the last sentence, if I understand you correctly, is actually you utilizing diffused mode thinking, which is one of the recommendations from those PDFs/books/course.

Absorb it, it's not like you are going to only need to know finance for a month and then never use it again in your entire life (as an investor).\n\n\nOne thing that upset me listening to a BP podcast was when they said IRR (Internal Rate of Return), NPV etc. and all those financial terms weren't worth learning about. That's why I think so many people have such a bad opinion of BP, once you get past the occasional hint on real estate investing, it's all just _feel good-ary_ stuff about having the _right mindset_ to take action (blah blah blah). Hearing that over and over again with out a strong focus on details like finance gets tiring quickly. BP is pretty much all hype with a thin layer of knowledge, which is terribly misleading for people getting started.", "created_utc": 1567737458, "gildings": {}, "id": "ez89i8d", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_d03rtx", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_ez86gga", "permalink": "/r/realestateinvesting/comments/d03rtx/is_biggerpockets_pro_worth_it/ez89i8d/", "retrieved_on": 1567737682, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "realestateinvesting", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnt1", "total_awards_received": 0, "created": 1567737458.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "villain_8_", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3nsgciac", "author_patreon_flair": false, "body": "this\nhttps://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn", "created_utc": 1567614365, "gildings": {}, "id": "eyzc4n9", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_czmud4", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_czmud4", "permalink": "/r/IWantToLearn/comments/czmud4/i_want_to_learn_how_to_learn/eyzc4n9/", "retrieved_on": 1567614366, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "IWantToLearn", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rjo5", "total_awards_received": 0, "created": 1567614365.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "izote_2000", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_pid9n", "author_patreon_flair": false, "body": "&gt;I have been told that you should watch the tutorial then try to create your own project\n\nWhat was the output of following that advice? \n\nSince you're asking 'Best learning techniques?'

Everything  builds on each other and is more practice-oriented than it is  theoretical. Although mathematical notation is used, everything is still  comparatively basic.\n\nAndrew Ng's ML course: [https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)  Even though the course may seem very demanding (I've needed three  attempts) at first, you'll remember him forever as Prof Ng explains the  basics of ML like hardly anyone else. However, the course shows its age  because MATLAB is not a language that is up-to-date for ML. When working  on the code assignments, you should therefore google for Python  implementations and work on them instead.\n\nThe other two courses are the logical continuation of Andrew Ng's first ML course.\n\nAndrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization: [https://de.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning](https://de.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)\n\nAndrew Ng's Tensorflow in Practice Specialization: [https://de.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice](https://de.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice)\n\nAfter that you are ready for advanced courses:\n\nOld but gold, the CS229 lectures of 2008: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzxYlbK2c7E&amp;list=PLA89DCFA6ADACE599](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzxYlbK2c7E&amp;list=PLA89DCFA6ADACE599)  This is Ng's coursera ML course on steroids. Have you wondered why  logistic regression uses the sigmoid function? Here you will find the  answer. Have you always wanted to know how to derive the Normal  Equation? Here you will find the answer. The course is sometimes bashed  on the fact that it is old, but the reality is that the concepts  presented here also work in the age of neural networks and are sometimes  even preferable. Classical models just do their job well, too.\n\nAnd a modern rendition: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT1JzLTH4G4&amp;list=PLa-Bt050gYuhEeLRG8YBmFxwLvTJ5FqPS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT1JzLTH4G4&amp;list=PLa-Bt050gYuhEeLRG8YBmFxwLvTJ5FqPS)  Any criticism of the above course is nullified, as there is a current  version of it. The focus here is more on neural networks, but that's why  the old CS229 course is not outclassed.\n\nI also like this set of online lectures: [http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4780/2018fa/lectures/](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4780/2018fa/lectures/)  Somehow I always come across these lectures while doing my own  research. I think they are very good and the focus is rather  probabilistic. The only catch, in my opinion, is that the lecturer's  handwriting is very bad, which is why I always have the handout open in  parallel. His accent is also funny.\n\n# Programming Skills\n\nHere I had to start from zero but I learned a lot in my complementary  computer science studies, so I can't recommend as many resources as in  the other sections. But when studying Python, I refered to Corey Schafer  a lot, who has many wonderful Python tutorials on Youtube: [https://www.youtube.com/user/schafer5/playlists](https://www.youtube.com/user/schafer5/playlists)\n\nThere are also two books that I can recommend for learning Python, especially for ML and Data Science applications:\n\n[https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)  It contains all important information about the packages NumPy, Pandas  and Matplotlib, which are all used again and again when you want to  program ML algorithms or prepare and visualize the necessary data.\n\n[https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml)  Please buy the paperback, the author deserves it. This book is the best  application-oriented resource I know. I often find myself referring to  this book.\n\nAlways try to implement the knowledge directly, i.e. to reprogram  algorithms in Python. If that's too hard, google the code and try to  understand it, we all do. Get familiar with the Scikit-Learn library and  Tensorflow and try to complete small projects that you can upload to  Github. You won't get any better without practice.
