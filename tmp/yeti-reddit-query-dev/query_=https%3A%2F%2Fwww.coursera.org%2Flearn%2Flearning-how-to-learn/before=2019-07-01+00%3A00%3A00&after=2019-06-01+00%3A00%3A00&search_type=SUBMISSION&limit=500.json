Use both diffuse and focused thinking. \n2. Use the pomodoro method to reduce procrastination. \n3. Repetition and practice are key. \n4. Use chunking; remove distractions when working, ensure understanding of the key concept of the chunk, establish the context of when the chunk should be used. \n5. Use physical exercise to access diffuse thinking. \n6. Never multitask, because focusing on more than one thing is almost impossible. \n7. Don't reread the textbook/notes, use active recall. \n8. Surround yourself with productive and stimulating people. \n9. Being passionate and persistent is more important than being smart. \n10. Illusion of confidence: when you think you know/understand something when you are reading about it, but when the resource you are using is taken away, you don't. \n11. Procrastination is a habit. Habits are made of **routines** in response to **cues** which produce **rewards**, and reinforced by **beliefs**. By changing these factors, procrastination can be reduced, as the habit fades. \n12. Focus on the process, not the product. Break the task down into parts and work your way through these over time rather than attempting to tackle all of it at once. \n13. Break your day and week down into tasks and set a specific time for studying, e.g. 9-5, and stick to this. Do the hardest task first. \n14. Humans evolved to have better visual and spatial memory than semantic/conceptual memory, so use mental images to remember things. \n15. Shorter but regular study over time is more effective than trying to study something in a single longer session. \n16. Simplify material into meaningful groups to make learning easier: use abbreviations, use mnemonics, associate words/numbers with feelings or personal events, and use the memory palace technique. \n17. Create metaphors or analogies to help remember concepts. \n18. Take responsibility for your own learning. \n19. Catch blind spots and errors by rechecking work and working with others. \n20. Sleep is essential to retaining learnt information, so make sure you get plenty. \n21. During tests, tackle the hardest questions first, but switch to an easier one and come back to them if you get stuck; keep the momentum going. \n22. The way you think about stress affects your performance. Switch your thinking from \"i'm afraid\" to \"this stress will make me more motivated.\"  \n23. If you are excessively stressed, focus on your breathing and put a hand on your stomach, feeling the rise and fall to calm yourself. \n24. Before doing an important test, make sure you have a plan B for if the test doesn't go well. This will make your less anxious, improving focus. \n25. The day before a test, keep study relatively light to ensure mental energy is preserved for the test.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "GetStudying", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tl44", "subreddit_subscribers": 79811, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I made a summary of the \"Learning how to learn\" course on coursera.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1561550908, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/c57lsr/i_made_a_summary_of_the_learning_how_to_learn/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1561464527.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "careertroubleguy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_12pbj8", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1560866565, "domain": "self.datascience", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/c22mg0/my_reviews_of_8_python_deep_learning_computer/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c22mg0", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "education", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "99f9652a-d780-11e7-b558-0e52cdd59ace", "link_flair_text": "Education", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 33, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/datascience/comments/c22mg0/my_reviews_of_8_python_deep_learning_computer/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1560866566, "score": 185, "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\nlink to the original reviews -  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/b97hdk/a\\_review\\_of\\_5\\_python\\_deep\\_learning\\_computer/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/b97hdk/a_review_of_5_python_deep_learning_computer/)\n\n**June-16-2019: UPDATE**: I completed two new CV courses:\n\n1.

I didn't know why I didn't do this sooner! Complex concepts are broken down so well by Andrew Ng. However, it sort of jumps into complex code a bit quick. Lots of courses tend to do this. It feels like a typical college course where you're taught the theory but not the execution.\n\n**Pros**:\n\n\\- Very well taught! Perhaps the best explanations of any course here.\n\n\\- Covers the key concepts of CNNs, Object Detection very well!\n\n\\- Covers mostly all the key CV topics\n\n**Cons**:\n\n\\- Not a big picture or big project type course, the code you do is more about understanding the principles rather than doing something impressive.\n\n\\- It's not a course that will teach u to do things, rather it's focused on understanding what you're doing.\n\n\\- Can be expensive since it's $49/mo but if you finish it within that month or even the 7/day trial it's an excellent value.\n\n**Score - 4.5/5**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Deep Learning and Computer Vision A-Z\u2122: OpenCV, SSD &amp; GANs](https://www.udemy.com/computer-vision-a-z/) \\-  Created by [Hadelin de Ponteves](https://www.udemy.com/computer-vision-a-z/#instructor-1), [Kirill Eremenko](https://www.udemy.com/computer-vision-a-z/#instructor-2), [SuperDataScience Team](https://www.udemy.com/computer-vision-a-z/#instructor-3)\n\n**Review** \\- **UPDATE**: I initially gave this course a relatively poor review, but I realized I had mistakenly confused some of the content with another [course](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-computer-vision/). This course was very good. The problem I had is that it's not good for actually learning Computer Vision core basics. You'll be able to do a few fun projects after, but it doesn't teach you principles and how to do a lot of this on your own custom projects. Overall though, it's well presented and taught well.\n\n**Pros**:\n\n\\- Good variety of core content\n\n\\- His code works (always a plus since libraries and packages get updated frequently)\n\n\\- Fun projects\n\n**Cons**:\n\n\\- Little core basics as it's more of a cookbook type course. Other courses are like this, but many teach the basis before moving onto a project.\n\n\\- Some fluff and overly long videos.

It's not a Deep Learning course though, at most he has a basic intro to using Keras, and how to implement CIFAR10 and MNIST, but those things are everywhere. The OpenCV and CV Basics are taught very well! And I like his voice and positivity. He's a good teacher and does it well.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n\\- Covers the basics of OpenCV well\n\n\\- All code works\n\n\\- Has a Deep Learning section for added value\n\n\\- The instructor is upbeat and easy to follow\n\n**Cons:**\n\n\\- The Deep Learning stuff is basic and pretty much fluff to boost the 'value' of this course.

It was my go-to reference in doing so many things. The content in this course is insane and he provides a full Virtual Machine with everything pre-installed (useful as all code works perfectly!). The explanations are very good. He doesn't always go into detail, but when he does it's taught quite well. The only issue I have is that I can see beginners sometimes being turned off since he rarely explains the code. He's more like \"here's the code that does this, this line this and this function was built to do this\". If you're a beginner it's understandable you'd be confused. However, the code, content, and number of projects were far more than the other courses, probably even put together (except for the PyImage course, but we'll get there). So to me, it's worth it. It covers all the details of Computer Vision rather than just pieces that look cool.\n\n**UPDATE**: Shortly after I posted the review I noticed Rajeev added some new content regarding using PaperSpace and deploying your CV model on AWS as an API (quite cool!)\n\n**Pros:**\n\n\\- Amazing and detailed content\n\n\\- Excellent theoretical explanations\n\n\\- Shows you how to get the best performance out of a CNN and built a variety of things\n\n\\- Very fun projects!\n\n\\- An enthusiastic teacher who you can tell has a passion for CV\n\n\\- New content always being added it seems!\n\n**Cons:**\n\n\\- Not for absolute beginners, now none of these courses are, but this one goes from easy to relatively hard quickly.\n\n\\- Instructor at times talks too fast and skims explanations of code\n\n\\- Some of the content is text not video, so I didn't increase the score, but noted it regardless. Not really a con to be perfectly fair.\n\n**Score 4.6/5**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Computer Vision Intro\u2122 OpenCV4 in Python with Deep Learning](https://www.udemy.com/master-computer-vision-with-opencv-in-python/?couponCode=REDDIT) \\-  Created by [Rajeev Ratan](https://www.udemy.com/master-computer-vision-with-opencv-in-python/#instructor-1)\n\nThis is the older course of instructor above and it shows, it's been updated quite a bit, but some of the videos aren't the same as the code he provides. That isn't a deal breaker and he does mention it, but it sometimes does make you wonder if was a mistake or intentional. That said, all code is compatible with OpenCV4 which is awesome. Also the number of projects makes it quite a nice course to get some good practical OpenCV knowledge. A Virtual Machine is also provided (nice touch!). This course has some excellent OpenCV tutorials, fun projects and there is some added Deep Learning stuff so it's quite cool, not as much fluff and good explanations again.\n\n**UPDATE**: Shortly after I posted the review I noticed Rajeev added some new content such as using Caffee models in OpenCV to colorize black and white images and some other object detection stuff, really cool projects but not explained in too much depth, still cool regardless!\n\n**Pros:**\n\n\\- Easy to follow and I feel more of the OpenCV basics were thought\n\n\\- All code works and explanations are on point!\n\n\\- Bonus Deep Learning stuff\n\n\\- Fun Projects\n\n\\- Enthusiast Lecturer\n\n**Cons:**\n\n\\- Audio bad at some times (not much, maybe like 20 mins appears to have been recorded with his laptop mic vs external mic)\n\n\\- The code in the videos is not always the same as the downloadable code he provides\n\n**Score - 4.3/5**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Deep Learning: Advanced Computer Vision (Udemy)](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-computer-vision/)  \\- Created by  [Lazy Programmer Inc.](https://www.udemy.com/user/lazy-programmer/)\n\n**UPDATE**: I went back to this course and realized i might have unfairly slammed it. If you want exactly what's offered (look at the syllabus, it's taugh really well). But as a standalone CV course, it's lacking.\n\nI enjoyed this course, it doesn't cover very much but it does some of the basics fairly well. What I liked was that it moved relatively slow and spent a while on some details. BUT, to be, he didn't address how to this in any practical way. It's not a bad approach, but to me, it seems better suited for a university student trying to understand core concepts rather than someone who wants to build something new or from scratch.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n\\- Covers a few topics, but covers them well\n\n\\- If you like code-along courses this is for you, I used to like that style but I don't have the patience for it now. Too slow and tedious for me.\n\n\\- Explains Neural Style Transfers and VGG well\n\n**Cons:**\n\n\\- Outside of VGG Transfer Learning and ResNet, most of the stuff is very shallow. I don't feel like I've learned anything I couldn't read in a blog somewhere (can be said about most courses but this one seemed very much lacking in detail).\n\n\\- Code along courses are good, but tend to waste a lot of time. I'm not a total noob.

Absolute perfect and monster of a course! Now it's expensive compared to the others, but this course teaches almost everything you'll need. I wish the ImageNet Bundle was included at this price, but that module is over $600. This course covers all key areas of Deep Learning in Computer Vision. It does not have any OpenCV (well some, but PIL or imultils are used more often). The videos aren't detailed, you're paying for the detailed textbooks, the videos are pretty much overviews of each chapter. So, yes the course material and code is where the value is, and it's excellent in quality!\n\nThe code isn't always super easy to follow, but he explains almost every line in the book so it's not a complaint, just stating that this isn't a course that's going to be easily accessible to begineers. Also, like some of the others above, it comes with a Virtual Machine with all packages pre-installed.\n\n**UPDATE**: I initially rated the value of this course as 3.5/5 but I'm bumping it 4.1. Adrian and his community will offer to very good help to your research projects etc. So if you're stuck on need advice, it's valuable. Rajeev and Jose will often offer similar support in their Udemy forums, but Adrian's depth and expertise shines if the problem is particularly hard or grounding breaking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Pros:**\n\n\\- Probably the best resources for Practical Deep Learning Computer Vision online\n\n\\- Excellent explanations by a very experienced and passionate teacher\n\n\\- All code is explained nicely\n\n\\- Because of his experience, you know he covers the most relevant and important topics\n\n**Cons:**\n\n\\- Not for beginners, obviously, but it should be noted if you're a beginner you will feel overwhelmed going into this course\n\n\\- Explanations on video are mostly fluff, he doesn't really teach. It's more of an overview of what's covered in the book (which is the real meat of the course)\n\n\\- Expensive!\n\n**Score - 4.5/5**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven though I initially rated Rajeev's Udemy course the highest, it's only because of the insanely cheap price of $10. It's a great course and I keep coming back to it a lot. That said, when it goes up against Adrian's $300. It can't compete with the detail and explanations offered in Adrian's text. And I don't know how I missed Andrew Ng's Coursera's course, but the theory explanations in that course are best out all so far (Rajeev and Adrian do an excellent job too).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**NOTE**: I got around to reviewing Adrian's other bundles. I have a friend who purchased the ImageNet Bundle and he lent me the printed text (which has been updated since). But I don't have access to the videos. Here's a quick summary of the PyImage 3 Bundles\n\n* STARTER BUNDLE - Very good value and an excellent resource. Covers all the basics in detail but doesn't get into more advanced and cooler areas of computer vision such as Object Detection and advanced CNNs.\n* PRACTITIONER BUNDLE - Highly recommend you purchase this instead of the Starter Bundle. It's excellent and covers pretty much everything you'd need to know in Computer Vision Deep Learning\n* ImageNet Bundle - It's excellent, but to me not really worth double the price of the Practitioner Bundle. It does have some nice projects and some advanced stuff. I was impressed nevertheless, but in terms of actual theory and knowledge, it's not much new content when compared to Practitioner Bundle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn summary, I'll put it like this. For a $10 Udemy course, Rajeev's course will take you from beginner to a working professional. But to be an expert, you'll need Adrian's (of PyImage) course. Andrew Ng's course will ensure you're understanding key concepts right, it's brilliant in breaking down the theory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeel free to ask me any questions on the above courses.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "datascience", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sptq", "subreddit_subscribers": 126002, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My reviews of 8 Python Deep Learning Computer Vision Courses (LONG)", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1560952949, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/c22mg0/my_reviews_of_8_python_deep_learning_computer/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1560866565.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "careertroubleguy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_12pbj8", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1560791744, "domain": "self.Python", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/c1q8sd/update_a_review_of_8_python_deep_learning/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c1q8sd", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/Python/comments/c1q8sd/update_a_review_of_8_python_deep_learning/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1560791745, "score": 11, "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\nlink to the original reviews -  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/b97hdk/a\\_review\\_of\\_5\\_python\\_deep\\_learning\\_computer/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/b97hdk/a_review_of_5_python_deep_learning_computer/)\n\n**June-16-2019: UPDATE**: I completed two new CV courses:\n\n1.

Not bad for beginners though, especially if you're looking to learn PyTorch. \n\n**Pros**:\n\n\\- Very well taught \n\n\\- Basics covered well, lots of time spent on Neural Nets and CNNs \n\n\\- Transfer Learning is well taught\n\n\\- Teaches PyTorch very well \n\n**Cons**:\n\n\\- Only covers the basics and doesn't go into more advanced territory\n\n\\- Lacks cool projects\n\n**Score - 4.2/5**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Computer Vision - Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/convolutional-neural-networks/computer-vision-Ob1nR) \\- by Andrew Ng\n\n**Review** \\- Excellent Course! I didn't know why I didn't do this sooner! Complex concepts are broken down so well by Andrew Ng. However, it sort of jumps into complex code a bit quick. Lots of courses tend to do this. It feels like a typical college course where you're taught the theory but not the execution.\n\n**Pros**:\n\n\\- Very well taught! Perhaps the best explanations of any course here.\n\n\\- Covers the key concepts of CNNs, Object Detection very well! \n\n\\- Covers mostly all the key CV topics\n\n**Cons**:\n\n\\- Not a big picture or big project type course, the code you do is more about understanding the principles rather than doing something impressive. \n\n\\- It's not a course that will teach u to do things, rather it's focused on understanding what you're doing. \n\n\\- Can be expensive since it's $49/mo but if you finish it within that month or even the 7/day trial it's an excellent value. \n\n**Score - 4.5/5**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Deep Learning and Computer Vision A-Z\u2122: OpenCV, SSD &amp; GANs](https://www.udemy.com/computer-vision-a-z/) \\-  Created by [Hadelin de Ponteves](https://www.udemy.com/computer-vision-a-z/#instructor-1), [Kirill Eremenko](https://www.udemy.com/computer-vision-a-z/#instructor-2), [SuperDataScience Team](https://www.udemy.com/computer-vision-a-z/#instructor-3)\n\n**Review** \\- **UPDATE**: I initially gave this course a relatively poor review, but I realized I had mistakenly confused some of the content with another [course](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-computer-vision/). This course was very good. The problem I had is that it's not good for actually learning Computer Vision core basics. You'll be able to do a few fun projects after, but it doesn't teach you principles and how to do a lot of this on your own custom projects. Overall though, it's well presented and taught well. \n\n**Pros**:\n\n\\- Good variety of core content\n\n\\- His code works (always a plus since libraries and packages get updated frequently)\n\n\\- Fun projects\n\n**Cons**:\n\n\\- Little core basics as it's more of a cookbook type course. Other courses are like this, but many teach the basis before moving onto a project. \n\n\\- Some fluff and overly long videos. A bit inconsistent in what's taught well and what's skimmed. \n\n**Score - 4.2/5**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Python for Computer Vision with OpenCV and Deep Learning](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-computer-vision-with-opencv-and-deep-learning/) \\-  Created by [Jose Portilla](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-computer-vision-with-opencv-and-deep-learning/#instructor-1)\n\nI enjoyed this course quite a bit. It's not a Deep Learning course though, at most he has a basic intro to using Keras, and how to implement CIFAR10 and MNIST, but those things are everywhere. The OpenCV and CV Basics are taught very well! And I like his voice and positivity. He's a good teacher and does it well.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n\\- Covers the basics of OpenCV well\n\n\\- All code works\n\n\\- Has a Deep Learning section for added value\n\n\\- The instructor is upbeat and easy to follow\n\n**Cons:**\n\n\\- The Deep Learning stuff is basic and pretty much fluff to boost the 'value' of this course. It's very basic and can be found elsewhere for free\n\n\\- It doesn't have that many cool projects to do\n\n**Score 4.3/5**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Deep Learning Computer Vision\u2122 CNN, OpenCV, YOLO, SSD &amp; GANs](https://www.udemy.com/master-deep-learning-computer-visiontm-cnn-ssd-yolo-gans/?couponCode=REDDIT) \\-  Created by [Rajeev Ratan](https://www.udemy.com/master-computer-vision-with-opencv-in-python/#instructor-1)\n\nI loved this course! It was my go-to reference in doing so many things. The content in this course is insane and he provides a full Virtual Machine with everything pre-installed (useful as all code works perfectly!). The explanations are very good. He doesn't always go into detail, but when he does it's taught quite well. The only issue I have is that I can see beginners sometimes being turned off since he rarely explains the code. He's more like \"here's the code that does this, this line this and this function was built to do this\". If you're a beginner it's understandable you'd be confused. However, the code, content, and number of projects were far more than the other courses, probably even put together (except for the PyImage course, but we'll get there). So to me, it's worth it. It covers all the details of Computer Vision rather than just pieces that look cool.\n\n**UPDATE**: Shortly after I posted the review I noticed Rajeev added some new content regarding using PaperSpace and deploying your CV model on AWS as an API (quite cool!)\n\n**Pros:**\n\n\\- Amazing and detailed content\n\n\\- Excellent theoretical explanations\n\n\\- Shows you how to get the best performance out of a CNN and built a variety of things\n\n\\- Very fun projects!\n\n\\- An enthusiastic teacher who you can tell has a passion for CV\n\n\\- New content always being added it seems!\n\n**Cons:**\n\n\\- Not for absolute beginners, now none of these courses are, but this one goes from easy to relatively hard quickly.\n\n\\- Instructor at times talks too fast and skims explanations of code\n\n\\- Some of the content is text not video, so I didn't increase the score, but noted it regardless. Not really a con to be perfectly fair.\n\n**Score 4.6/5**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Computer Vision Intro\u2122 OpenCV4 in Python with Deep Learning](https://www.udemy.com/master-computer-vision-with-opencv-in-python/?couponCode=REDDIT) \\-  Created by [Rajeev Ratan](https://www.udemy.com/master-computer-vision-with-opencv-in-python/#instructor-1)\n\nThis is the older course of instructor above and it shows, it's been updated quite a bit, but some of the videos aren't the same as the code he provides. That isn't a deal breaker and he does mention it, but it sometimes does make you wonder if was a mistake or intentional. That said, all code is compatible with OpenCV4 which is awesome. Also the number of projects makes it quite a nice course to get some good practical OpenCV knowledge. A Virtual Machine is also provided (nice touch!). This course has some excellent OpenCV tutorials, fun projects and there is some added Deep Learning stuff so it's quite cool, not as much fluff and good explanations again.\n\n**UPDATE**: Shortly after I posted the review I noticed Rajeev added some new content such as using Caffee models in OpenCV to colorize black and white images and some other object detection stuff, really cool projects but not explained in too much depth, still cool regardless!\n\n**Pros:**\n\n\\- Easy to follow and I feel more of the OpenCV basics were thought\n\n\\- All code works and explanations are on point!\n\n\\- Bonus Deep Learning stuff\n\n\\- Fun Projects\n\n\\- Enthusiast Lecturer\n\n**Cons:**\n\n\\- Audio bad at some times (not much, maybe like 20 mins appears to have been recorded with his laptop mic vs external mic)\n\n\\- The code in the videos is not always the same as the downloadable code he provides\n\n**Score - 4.3/5**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Deep Learning: Advanced Computer Vision (Udemy)](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-computer-vision/)  \\- Created by  [Lazy Programmer Inc.](https://www.udemy.com/user/lazy-programmer/)\n\n**UPDATE**: I went back to this course and realized i might have unfairly slammed it. If you want exactly what's offered (look at the syllabus, it's taugh really well). But as a standalone CV course, it's lacking. \n\nI enjoyed this course, it doesn't cover very much but it does some of the basics fairly well. What I liked was that it moved relatively slow and spent a while on some details. BUT, to be, he didn't address how to this in any practical way. It's not a bad approach, but to me, it seems better suited for a university student trying to understand core concepts rather than someone who wants to build something new or from scratch.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n\\- Covers a few topics, but covers them well\n\n\\- If you like code-along courses this is for you, I used to like that style but I don't have the patience for it now. Too slow and tedious for me.\n\n\\- Explains Neural Style Transfers and VGG well\n\n**Cons:**\n\n\\- Outside of VGG Transfer Learning and ResNet, most of the stuff is very shallow. I don't feel like I've learned anything I couldn't read in a blog somewhere (can be said about most courses but this one seemed very much lacking in detail).\n\n\\- Code along courses are good, but tend to waste a lot of time. I'm not a total noob. I don't need to be reminded to \"import numpy as np\" continuously.\n\n\\- Lacks interesting projects\n\n**Score - 3.9/5**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Deep Learning for Computer Vision with Python - Practitioner Bundle](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/deep-learning-computer-vision-python-book/) \\- Created by [Adrian Rosebrock](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/author/adrian/)\n\n(**NOTE** Adrian provided a 10% Coupon:  **reddit**)\n\nThis is the mother load. Absolute perfect and monster of a course! Now it's expensive compared to the others, but this course teaches almost everything you'll need. I wish the ImageNet Bundle was included at this price, but that module is over $600. This course covers all key areas of Deep Learning in Computer Vision. It does not have any OpenCV (well some, but PIL or imultils are used more often). The videos aren't detailed, you're paying for the detailed textbooks, the videos are pretty much overviews of each chapter. So, yes the course material and code is where the value is, and it's excellent in quality!\n\nThe code isn't always super easy to follow, but he explains almost every line in the book so it's not a complaint, just stating that this isn't a course that's going to be easily accessible to begineers.

Andrew Ng's course will ensure you're understanding key concepts right, it's brilliant in breaking down the theory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeel free to ask me any questions on the above courses.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Python", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh0y", "subreddit_subscribers": 374923, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "UPDATE: A review of 8 Python Deep Learning Computer Vision Courses (WARNING LONG)", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1560878129, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/c1q8sd/update_a_review_of_8_python_deep_learning/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6, "created": 1560791744.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "Kaori4Kousei", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_sq8pu4", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1560567447, "domain": "self.computervision", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/c0snf3/next_step_after_completing_computer_vision_basics/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c0snf3", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/computervision/comments/c0snf3/next_step_after_completing_computer_vision_basics/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1560567447, "score": 18, "selftext": "**My target:**  is to develop projects involving computer vision like object detection, face recognition, eye gaze tracking, etc and to also know how things are happening in the background.\n\n**What I've done yet:** I've successfully completed an introductory course by university of buffalo ([Computer Vision Basics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/computer-vision-basics/home/welcome)), and I am half way through their next course on [Image Processing, Features and Segmentation](https://www.coursera.org/learn/computervision-imageprocessing/home/welcome). The quality of the content provided, degraded overtime for this image processing course so I have kept the course on hold until the staff starts updating the exercises, etc. The syllabus of the course was very interesting like, edge detection, corner detection, 2-D Convolution Sobel Filter. \n\nOn MATLAB I've implemented 2-D Convolution Sobel Filter, implemented Prokudin-Gorskii method by combing RGB of an image with SSD within each layer of them.\n\nParallel to this, I've completed 50% of the book Practical Python and OpenCV By Adrian Rosebrock (Author of PyImageSearch). \n\nI've also done AndrewNG course till Logistic Regression and I am thinking about to continue it as Machine Learning is very helpful in Computer Vision.\n\n**What I am currently doing:** I've started ECSE-4540 but, I am unable to find any of its assignments online. If I will not solve the assignment questions then how will I be able to fully understand the concepts? \n\nI am continuing the book by Adrian Rosebrock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am an undergraduate who barely gets free 3-4 hours per day, can't waste it on something which doesn't lead to anywhere. I am looking for source/path that if I strictly follow will surely lead me to a point from which I can start working on my own projects. I am looking forward to get an internship related to Computer Vision/Machine Learning next year. \n\nSo, what should I do? Continue ECSE-4540 without assignments? Start something new? Delve directly in OpenCV?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "computervision", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rfzn", "subreddit_subscribers": 26488, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Next step after completing computer vision basics?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1560653828, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/c0snf3/next_step_after_completing_computer_vision_basics/", "created": 1560567447.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "TheBigGarrett", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2ivpnf89", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1560500448, "domain": "self.learnmath", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/c0hmaq/learning_cryptography_especially_additional/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c0hmaq", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/learnmath/comments/c0hmaq/learning_cryptography_especially_additional/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1560500449, "score": 1, "selftext": "I've sort of recognized that I have an interest for cryptography, and I would like to affirm that this is the route I should proceed in being an undergrad math major.
