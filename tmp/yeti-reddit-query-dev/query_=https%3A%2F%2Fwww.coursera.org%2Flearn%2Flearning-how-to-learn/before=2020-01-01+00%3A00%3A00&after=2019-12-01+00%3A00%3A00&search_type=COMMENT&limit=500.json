If you are somewhere with limited resources that can't afford multiple designers you're more likely to need to do both. In that case though you may end up doing all kinds of stuff. I've happily learned and worked on UX research, company strategy, visual and graphic design, UI work, testing and data science work, and front end development. \n\nUX is more about finding and fixing problems for different users and proving your work. Here is a helpful free course that is UX / Product design focused that you can try to see how you like it: https://www.coursera.org/learn/design\nThis also answers your final question. This course will prompt and motivate you to start a personal project that you can then choose to polish whichever parts you find you like the most (Visual Design, UI, Product, UX, etc etc).\n\nYou then use the UI patterns you have established to communicate to the users. If the UI patterns don't exist you need to create them and test them to ensure they are communicating the right intent. \n\nA great way to learn some awesome UI patterns, as well as learning new tools, is to find designs you like that already exist and trace over top if it. So for example if you wanted to get a better understanding of reddit's UI pattern library you could take screenshots of a bunch of views and trace over top of them in your UI program of choice. This helps you learn the patterns and the tools.\n\nSpeaking of tools, I'd recommend you use figma over sketch because:\n\n\u2022 it's free forever (limited projects but unlimited files in each project, so just make a project called something like 'my work' and another called 'client work' and then you still have 1 other project should you need it.)\n\u2022 awesome prototyping\n\u2022 sharing + collaboration like in google docs\n\u2022 it runs on any device not just mac os, \n\u2022 it's faster\n\u2022 better saves and version history\n\u2022 it has smart animations\n\n...and many more positives. I'm in the US for a top fortune 100 company and we just dropped sketch / invision for figma, and many of my peers at other companies have already done the same. Join the figma zietgiest. It's great here.\n\nLastly I'd recommend you find a mentor, though it sounds like you've got a few already helping out :D", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1577820973, "gildings": {}, "id": "fcnymyd", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ei7dwj", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_ei7dwj", "permalink": "/r/UserExperienceDesign/comments/ei7dwj/i_want_to_get_into_uiux/fcnymyd/", "retrieved_on": 1577820977, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "UserExperienceDesign", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ug9m", "total_awards_received": 0, "created": 1577820973.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "jediknight", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2smkc", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Recomand [Learning how to learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) pentru tehnici de invatat.

I found it while poking around The Odin Project (which teaches you how to program). Here is a link to the course  (it is free, and the free link to enroll is at the bottom of the page) :\n\n\nhttps://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn\n\n\n\nTo be honest, at first I did not think it was going to be anything very helpful, but I was wrong. \n\n\nIn short, the instructors talk about the difference in thinking in focused mode and diffused mode. Kinda like shower thoughts, where you gain inspiration by not thinking directly about what it is you are trying to achieve. (BTW, It is said that  Salvador Dali and Thomas Edison used this method, e.g. by falling asleep in a chair with ball bearings or keys in their hands, to get close to falling asleep and starting to dream, but waking up to remember their weird thoughts).\n\n\n\nA fair amount of time after taking the course, I actually read a book about learning math called \"A Mind for Numbers\" by Barbara Oakley and got halfway through before realizing that the author was one of the instructors from the course I mentioned. It's a cool read since it is about how she was a linguistics proffeser and ended up becoming a math and science professor with no math or science backgrounds and how she mastered these foreign subjects. But I also happen to like math, and I find these mundane things interesting. \n\n\n\nAnyway, to get back on topic, I find that going for a walk to clear the mind can be effective for writing music or finding inspiration as well. Maybe bring some headphones and listen to something that has inspired you, and alternate with silence. Listen to and experience the sounds around you. Or you could smoke pot. That *is* fun and seems to be the thing people are recommending.\n\n\n\nThe other thing that people are saying is to make goals and push yourself, and go ahead and make garbage.

I found that there really isn't a quick fix for developing decent executive functioning skills. People can tell you to make a list, but you can find a list overwhelming for example. Going to apologize beforehand, the bulk of my executive dysfunction has been focused around learning. Thus, it is a topic that I have readily available.\n\nI personally found that adopting something like the [pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is extremely useful. In which you decide on a given task and work on it for 25 minutes. Within this task you can start to experiment. So, for me, I started to use it for learning, inspired by Barbara Oakley MOOC [learning how to learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn), in order to use the 25 minutes for focused mode of thinking and the 5 minutes for diffuse mode. Within the 25 minutes you can find (or make) metrics in which you can measure how you are using your time, and thus in a way your executive functioning. If you are having to memorize things, then something like [Anki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anki_(software)) has a lot of metrics built in that you might be able to use in other settings.\n\nSo if you need to learn 50 terms, then through iterations you may find that with a given method that you can reasonable \"learn\" 10 terms per 25 minutes. How you determine what you've learned is up to you. Now that you have this loop that you can iterate, you can change the method slightly over similarly difficult content to see if you get any progress. Document it ([google sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) for example) if you can what you are doing, how you are doing it, and what the outcome is. Ideally you want to have a consistent outcome type in order to compare to other methods. Otherwise you run into the problem of trying to compare five bananas to three apples. What I found was that some methods are better than others in specific contexts and conditions. An example of context could be learning math is completely different than say English.  An example of a difference in learning conditions would be on a computer alone compared to writing in a spiral in public.\n\n**Takeaway from the anecdote**: Find a way to iterate through a task consistently ([pomodoro](https://tomato-timer.com/)), document what you've done and how you've done it ([google sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/)), experiment with information/methods/contexts, and learn how to do better by understanding yourself and techniques that have been developed.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1576708422, "gildings": {}, "id": "fbbuhw0", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_eak3do", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_eak3do", "permalink": "/r/aspergirls/comments/eak3do/how_do_you_build_up_better_executive_functioning/fbbuhw0/", "retrieved_on": 1576708424, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "aspergirls", "subreddit_id": "t5_31zba", "total_awards_received": 0, "created": 1576708422.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "cristianobaptista", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_yjtdf", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "There is also the Open Source Society University, which is an self-learning guide from beginner to very advanced: \nhttps://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/dev/README.md\n\nBefore you start trying to get some money out of programming, I believe you should really understand some basics from these courses:\n\n- https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python\n- https://www.coursera.org/specializations/computer-fundamentals\n- https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7\n- https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages\n- https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages-part-b\n- https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages-part-c\n- https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x\n\nAfter this you should be able to start learning most programming languages with some level of confidence that you kinda know what you are doing, and my advice is that you should start learning by doing before going through more advanced topics, using any of the other resources other people have shared with you.\n\nIf you want any more advice regarding how to start, feel free to message me directly.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1576694159, "gildings": {}, "id": "fbb67ik", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ecf8sz", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_ecf8sz", "permalink": "/r/learnprogramming/comments/ecf8sz/i_want_to_learn_programming_pretty_quickly_with/fbb67ik/", "retrieved_on": 1576694164, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "learnprogramming", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r7yd", "total_awards_received": 0, "created": 1576694159.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "SlingsAndArrowsOf", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4o4x82o3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Here's an amazing resource I've found - A free online course called \"Learning How to Learn\".
