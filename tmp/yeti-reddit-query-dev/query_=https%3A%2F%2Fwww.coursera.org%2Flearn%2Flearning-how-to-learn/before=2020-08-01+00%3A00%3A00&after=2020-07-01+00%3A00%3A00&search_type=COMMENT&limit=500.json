Everyone is different in their personality and challenges and need to find what works for their individual needs :) \n\nAs for the fear of failure, this is something I do struggle with but I only realised it in my final year of University. For example, I would approach an essay and want to make this incredible essay based on lots of smart points, but I'd hit a tiny block for a moment on how I would fit the information in to make a specific point, then you feel that level of stress rise and within literally 2-3 seconds you're doing a pointless task which is easily achievable and allows you to relax again....hmmm I wonder what products Amazon has on offer today, perhaps I need a new toaster to improve me life ;) \n\nI do think fear of failure, usually from perfectionists, is a driving force of procrastination.

For **testing yourself,** you don't necessarily have to make flash cards\u2026 I suppose you can just take your notes so that to have Active Recall questions there in a separate column (or maybe list them on a separate page).

For **spaced repetition:** check out *retrospective timetables.* Great explanations &amp; demo: 12:04-17:10 of [this video](https://youtu.be/ONG26-2mIHU?t=724). Ali (he was a *medical student at Cambridge* and is now a working doctor who also teaches some seminars? courses? at Cambridge) shows how he does them in Notion *(apparently, it's free for students),* but you'll see that you can also do it *in a paper notebook,* i.e. without exposing yourself to digital distractions.

That's because they change your gut bacteria for the better, and there is a quite solid link between your gut health and your brain health, through all those complex processes &amp; interactions in our bodies. \n\n1. research studies/reviews of them like https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30415609/ and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3904694/ and https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25448230/ and [this overview of research studies](https://nutrition.bmj.com/content/early/2020/06/09/bmjnph-2019-000053) \n2. it's better to eat fermented/probiotic FOODS than probiotic supplements because (1) \"probiotic supplements [unlike fermented foods] lack the bioactive proteins that can also affect the brain.\" (source)[https://www.wm.edu/research/news/science-and-technology/comfort-food123.php] - they are talking about peptides here and peptides, like probiotics, ALSO decrease the symptoms of depression ([data source](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13311-017-0585-0)); (2) it also saves money! :) you get full because it's a real food, you get vitamins &amp; minerals for your body &amp; brain (and better mental performance!), but you also improve your gut microbiome &amp; reduce anxiety &amp; depression! :)\n3. speaking of practical steps: [this is a good overview of 11 FOODS](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/11-super-healthy-probiotic-foods) that are considered probiotics. At least 2-3 foods from that list wil be available to you easily. \n\nTry &amp; see for yourself!\n\n**Also:** /u/kayvee2810 suggested **meditation** and yes, it's proved to be effective in decreasing depression. \n\nJust some relevant stuff, although you can find LOTS of relevant research studies online:\n\n1. This article explains WHY it has that effect &amp; even has references to specific research studies: https://www.healthline.com/health/meditation-for-depression\n2. And this article on Washington Post website is one-person experience: [Nothing worked for my depression \u2014 until I tried meditation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/inspired-life/wp/2018/02/26/nothing-worked-for-my-depression-until-i-tried-meditation/)\n\nSome people use apps like Headspace or Calm (both are top-recommended apps), some people just do a mindfulness meditation, e.g. see the instructions in the sidebar [in this article](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/04/less-stress-clearer-thoughts-with-mindfulness-meditation/) on Harvard University' site (it's under \"Mindfulness meditation made easy\").\n\n&gt; I used to be able to study 10h a day but now I only study 3-4 hours daily.\n\nYou can't study well for 10h a day on a daily basis without burning out. \n\n&gt; Help me get studying please.\n\n* Make your studying more effective &amp; efficient AND *active/engaging* by following neuroscience-based recommendations *(they adapted from the books that a very popular &amp; free online course on Coursera, [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn), is based on (in the course materials the lecturers provide the links to the supporting research studies))* : \n  * 10 rules of good studying and 10 rules of bad studying ([this 2-page PDF](http://www.math.toronto.edu/nhoell/10rules-of-studying.pdf)).\n  * a somewhat different version for kids &amp; teens ([this 2-page PDF](https://barbaraoakley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-Top-Ideas-to-Help-Your-Learning-and-10-Pitfalls-1.pdf)). \n* Some people use a simple digital kitchen timer for the Pomodoro technique, some people use apps like Forest or Tide.\n* You can make it more fun to use the Pomodoro technique by tracking your stats in a paper notebook, [a student's example](https://imgur.com/a/0YHJrXq) // Putting big checkmarks, marking the stuff as completed on paper/on a physical surface feels rewarding, by the way. Some people even make their todo for the day on a whiteboard because of that. \n* Another way to \"gamify\" your studying, make it more fun: progress bars. Examples for books/textbooks: [one example, explained in text](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/htcrrj/heeeeelp_how_can_i_concentrate_on_my_readings_for/fyg0v93/) and [another example, an image](https://imgur.com/a/2Dak6Vg). \n* For testing yourself, you don't necessarily have to make flash cards. You can just take your notes so that to have Active Recall questions there as a separate column (or maybe list them on a separate page). Cornell Notes template for note-taking accommodates the 1st option ([source 1](https://i.redd.it/d9cd0idpxs651.jpg) and [source 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_Notes) and [source 3](http://lsc.cornell.edu/notes.html)), in the first column. So, during your review, you just cover the right column (with your hand or a sheet of notepaper) and try to answer Questions in your 1st column.\n* If your exams require quite a LOT of studying, you might also want to check out *retrospective timetables* for spaced repetition ([these video explanations](https://youtu.be/ONG26-2mIHU?t=724) is great). Ali shows how he does it in Notion (it's free for students, apparently), but you'll see that you can do them in a notebook instead, i.e. without exposing yourself to digital distractions.\n\n*Edit: added stuff about meditation. // Edit #2: replaced research links about fermented foods / probiotics for better ones, added some explanations about why foods and not supplements. // Edit #3: quoted an article incorrectly, creating the opposite meaning from what was conveyed. fixed.*", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1595764811, "edited": 1595785233.0, "gildings": {}, "id": "fzalrg1", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_hy2ypp", "locked": false, "no_follow": false, "parent_id": "t3_hy2ypp", "permalink": "/r/GetStudying/comments/hy2ypp/how_do_i_study_with_depression/fzalrg1/", "retrieved_on": 1595804124, "score": 14, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "GetStudying", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tl44", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1595764811.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "grittypigeon", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4o0lwg4j", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "What helped me stay motivated when all else failed is taking this course: \n\nLearning How to Learn:\nhttps://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn\n\nWhen I dug deep, one of things that bothered me in learning when older is \"am I even learning right?

BUT I'm sure I'm still missing important details still and it's up to you to research the topic to the level that you need\u2026)*\n\n1. GOOD NEWS: There is \"Freshman Year for Free\" online program made possible by some non-profit, https://modernstates.org/ *(\"Take tuition-free, high quality courses online from top institutions for college credit.)\"* They explain how &amp; why it works on their home page and the universities partnered are great. *It involves preparation for and taking \"Placement and CLEP exams already accepted for credit by more than 2,900 colleges and universities.\"*\n2. GOOD NEWS: There is also such thing as \"Professional Certificate\" on MOOC platforms. It's a set of online courses by a big company (Microsoft, Google, IBM, etc.) that as if prepare you for doing a particular job. You pay a fee for the certificate though *(but I suppose its cost is very low compared to taking a proper college course)* Examples of such programs on Coursera: https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates \n3. GOOD NEWS: apparently, at least some of such sets of courses for \"Professional Certificate\" CAN give you college credits. Example: *\"The Google IT Support Professional Certificate program recently secured a credit recommendation from the American Council on Education (ACE) ACE CREDIT\u00ae, which is the industry standard for translating workplace learning to college credit. Learners can earn a recommendation of 12 college credits for completing the program--the equivalent of four college courses at the associate degree-level. This aims to help open up additional pathways to learners who are interested in higher education, and prepare them for entry-level jobs.\"* [source](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-support#enroll)\n4. BAD + GOOD NEWS: Turns out, getting *onine degrees* through MOOC platforms &amp; partnered universities costs quite big money, BUT the good news is that *an online degree costs about twice less than \"offline\" degree,* e.g. check comparison stats for specific programs at [source 1](https://www.classcentral.com/pricing-charts/mooc-based-degrees), basic stats at [source 2](https://www.coursera.org/degrees) (it's on the infographic) and some stats in [source 3]( https://www.classcentral.com/report/mooc-based-masters-degree/). // There are also [these explanations](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2018-10-10-5-ways-mooc-based-degrees-are-different-from-other-online-degrees) about the benefits/specifics of online degrees through MOOCs, although they are back from 2018. \n5. BAD NEWS: Turns out, a paid certificate (with identity verification) for a course completion on MOOC platforms *doesn't equal a college credit certificate,* like I thought before. // Example for edX platform, about Harvard\u2019s Computer Science Intro (CS50)): \"the free certificate does not include identity verification. Students may instead choose to pay $90 for a verified certificate on edX. *Or they may pay $1840 to $2840* to take the course through Harvard Extension School, in which case they\u2019ll have access to a formal transcript *and earn academic credit upon completion of the course.\"* ([source](https://www.classcentral.com/report/cs50-free-certificate/).\n6. BAD NEWS: Turns out, getting *a college credit* for the course *(unless you were doing it as part of your online degree through MOOC platform &amp; partnered university)* isn't a guaranteed thing. (a) Only *some* courses on MOOC platforms are eligible for college credits.// (b) There is usually an additional fee, something like $100-200 per college credit I suppose // (c) I still don't understand how it works if you aren't enrolled in an online degree OR \"Professional Certificate\" program I listed in #3 above, so *you'd have to research it yourself.* (ask customer support of MOOC platforms or whatever). E.g. edX has specific \"credit-eligible courses\" *on the bottom of this page https://www.edx.org/credit (e.g. courses by Arizona State University) and they have also 2 credit-eligible courses by Charter Oak college https://www.edx.org/charter-oak You might want to go through all list items here https://www.mooclab.club/resources/categories/moocs-for-credits.10/ (there are some opportunities by FutureLearn, a UK platform; and by some French platform too) although I've already found that some info there is outdated.\n7. GOOD NEWS: *because of COVID, some MOOC platforms made their verified certificates of course completion free *(but such certificates don't equal a college credit!)* The full list of free stuff and time limitations is at https://www.classcentral.com/report/free-online-learning-coronavirus/  // E.g. in case of Coursera the rules are very specific, their \"free\" offer is only for students: certificates for 155 courses are free only for \"college and university students\" *if you signup by July 31* and *finish by September 30.* \n\n\n---\n\nNow, about studying, just in case: \n\n* There are science-based recommendations for effective &amp; efficient studying. E.g. check out the following 2 reference files *(I've found that advice working well even for my ADHD brain, except for \"Make a mental contrast\")* that are adapted from the books that a very popular &amp; free online course on Coursera, [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn), is based on (in the course materials the lecturers provide the links to the supporting research studies):\n  * 10 rules of good studying and 10 rules of bad studying ([this 2-page PDF](http://www.math.toronto.edu/nhoell/10rules-of-studying.pdf)).\n  * a somewhat different version for kids &amp; teens ([this 2-page PDF](https://barbaraoakley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-Top-Ideas-to-Help-Your-Learning-and-10-Pitfalls-1.pdf)). \n  * you can make it more fun to use Pomodoro technique by tracking your stats in a paper notebook, [a student's example](https://imgur.com/a/0YHJrXq) // Putting checkmarks, marking the stuff as completed on paper/on a physical surface feels rewarding, by the way. Other people in ADHD sub mentioned using a whiteboard for their todo lists for those reasons - a big cross/checkmark to mark the item as completed feels really rewarding. \n* For testing yourself, you don't necessarily have to make flash cards. You can just take your notes so that to have Active Recall questions there as a separate column (or maybe list them on a separate page). Cornell Notes template for note-taking accommodates the 1st option ([source 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_Notes) and [source 2](http://lsc.cornell.edu/notes.html)), in the first column. \n* Tricks *specifically for online courses:*\n   * Personally, I can learn stuff from video lectures only if I *don't look at the video* &amp; only listen to it (unless there is a visual aid there like a diagram, etc.). I switch to an empty browser tab and look at it OR just look down. That's because everything that's visually happening in the video (the lecturer's face &amp; hands moving, the colors &amp; patterns &amp; objects in the backgrounds) is too distracting\u2026 I zone out of what the lecturer is talking about.\n   * Doodle during lectures/talks. It improves focus, comprehension &amp; retention of the information. These two articles ([one, by The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-power-of-the-doodle-improve-your-focus-and-memory-1406675744) and [two, by Harvard Medical School](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/the-thinking-benefits-of-doodling-2016121510844)) provide explanations behind that, personal accounts &amp; links to the supporting research studies. // *You don't have to be intentional about what you doodle \u2014 just let your hand draw what it wants, whether it's just hatching or spirals or something more complex.* // I actually tried that with videos for some Coursera course. Watched one video while doodling and another video without doodling. Information retention was definitely much much better in the 1st case. And I was frequently zoning out during the 2nd video!\n   * Advice from a grad student with ADHD, [from this comment:](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/humvsb/how_to_stop_skin_reading_with_adhd/fynzlpc/): *\"for videos or audio, I knit while I listen. Some people doodle or have fidget toys. Keeping my hands busy helps me actually listen to and process what's being said. For some reason sometimes speeding something up helps (maybe the less detail heavy and more wordy things - too slow and I get bored and my mind wanders), and sometimes slowing it down helps (probably the more technical detailed stuff). I also pause and rewind a lot, no way can I keep up in real time.\"*", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1595569667, "gildings": {}, "id": "fz2axem", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_hw3zlc", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_fyznk0m", "permalink": "/r/ADHD/comments/hw3zlc/selfeducating_while_procrastinating_on_school/fz2axem/", "retrieved_on": 1595636775, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ADHD", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qnwb", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1595569667.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "n0tKamui", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2vkwcxbb", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "All free (and made/supported by JetBrains):\n\n[https://play.kotlinlang.org/koans/overview](https://play.kotlinlang.org/koans/overview)\n  \n[https://hyperskill.org/](https://hyperskill.org/)\n \n[https://www.coursera.org/learn/kotlin-for-java-developers](https://www.coursera.org/learn/kotlin-for-java-developers?#syllabus)\n\nI highly recommend you to do the Koans because they're simple and teaches you the basics with great examples.\n\nAnother thing that the others forgot to mention : I know you want to make an app as quickly as possible, but I'd advise not to forget that learning the basics is REALLY important to make something great (How could you build a building if the first floor ain't stable, y'know).\n\nSo I really recommend you to go through those courses above (and not Android courses immediately) to get a grasp on the concepts of Object Oriented and Functional Programming.\n\nAlso, don't forget that the documentation will always be your best friend.  \n[https://kotlinlang.org/docs](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/basic-types.html)\n\nWhen you think you got everything up (and did some small console apps/games), you can then start doing mobile apps.\n\nOf course, in the end, the choice is yours, and all I said are just advises, you do you.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1595523097, "edited": 1595584173.0, "gildings": {}, "id": "fyzv7t2", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_hwfeu3", "locked": false, "no_follow": false, "parent_id": "t3_hwfeu3", "permalink": "/r/Kotlin/comments/hwfeu3/request_where_do_i_learn_kotlin_from_could/fyzv7t2/", "retrieved_on": 1595586107, "score": 8, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Kotlin", "subreddit_id": "t5_2so2r", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1595523097.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "perdidoemmim", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_7d0a788c", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Cursei meu ensino m\u00e9dio em escola p\u00fablica e tamb\u00e9m tive a mesma experi\u00eancia.

The cause is ignorance, craving, attachments. Don't mix up terms.   \n\n\n&gt;That \"seeing\" is to simply accept that reality is ever changing and individual existence is an illusion, based on the fact there are no concrete beginnings and ends to say one thing or being is separate from any other.   \n\n\nThere's a lot of concepts here, not all are useful to bunch up like that. Seeing here you might have refer to vipassana meditation, to see things as they really are. Impermanent, suffering, not self. Not self is due to seeing impermanence and suffering in body and mind (is something which is changing, and thus not in your full control, thus subject to suffering worth calling/ identifying as self?), not due to beginningless rebirth, and there can be an end to rebirth called Nibbana.   \n\n\n&gt;As such nothing can ever be truly gained from desire. Therfore enlightenment is achieved by seeing and accepting this, that there is no good or bad, there are no constants, there is no self, there is only the way things are, thus we free ourselves from duhkha be being content with existing as a selfless expression of reality.\n\nCraving is false promise of permanent happiness, to crave is to suffer, as one is slave to craving to need to satisfy it or suffer. There is conventional truth level good and bad kamma in thoughts, speech and actions. Beyond good and bad is used to indicate that arahants are no longer capable of producing kamma, but they also eradicated all roots of evil, so they are inherently good, by nature incapable of evil. \n\n&gt;While I feel I understand these concepts and the logical progression of thinking, it doesn't actually make sense to me. If we are to simply accept that reality is then how is enlightenment not just sitting there and dying, we have to eat, drink. If that is an acceptable desire because it is part of being alive, why is anything else any different? Surely any desire is as much a part of life as any other. If the goal is to accept reality for what it is in each individual moment and to act without thought, why does this exclude desire?\n\nSeparate out chanda and tanha.  [https://www.tbcm.org.my/desire-ta%E1%B9%87ha-versus-chanda/](https://www.tbcm.org.my/desire-ta%E1%B9%87ha-versus-chanda/) tanha causes suffering, chanda is how enlightened ones are still capable of doing things to keep their body alive. The enlightened ones has no preference for living or dying, but the arahants needs to be monks/nuns so they alive by following the traditions of monks and nuns and have compassion for the world to teach the world how to attain the same thing they attained. You cannot attain to enlightenment without walking the noble 8fold path. Part of it is indeed, just sit there and do nothing in meditation, going deep in letting go.   \n\n\n&gt;Furthermore the notion that the self doesn't exist, or that nothing exists conceptually makes no sense. While I have no concrete beginning, no moment in time where I began to exist, no one can deny that I do exist right now. Not only that but I exist independent of the rest of existence. My thought are unique to me, my emotions, my memories, experiences, knowledge, all of it is unique to my existence. If it is not shared and wholly mine then how I can not exist as an individual?\n\nDelusion of self is what makes you think self exist, it's the one thing which unenlightened beings has from beginningless rebirth. Not self doesn't deny individuals. After all, the Buddha attained to enlightenment, doesn't make you automatically enlightened. Self here refers to a fictional story which we tell ourselves. What we can directly perceive is only the 6 sense objects, the 5 aggregates. All of which are impermanent, and subject to suffering, thus not worth considered as self. It's the story we spin when we are not mindful which helps build and maintain this delusion of self exist. No unchanging soul could be seen. This is supported by modern psychology.  [https://www.coursera.org/learn/science-of-meditation](https://www.coursera.org/learn/science-of-meditation)   \n\n\nThis is my analogy of self as company: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/dupv3v/not\\_self\\_emptiness\\_using\\_the\\_example\\_of\\_a\\_company/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/dupv3v/not_self_emptiness_using_the_example_of_a_company/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)  \n\n\nWe acknowledge that a company doesn't truly exist, but merely is a collective fiction. So too is the self.  \n\n\n&gt;More than anything I don't see the point? What does Buddhism try to provide? If emptiness and surrendering the self is the goal then why not just die? If that's not the goal then what is? If Buddhism is actually the acceptance that reality continues in spite of what we wish it were, or what we try to make it, what is one supposed to do with that information? Isn't that just apathy? If that is how one is supposed to live then nothing would ever change, unless we accept that reality includes the human drive to shape it which brings me full circle.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;What am I not considering?\n\nThere's no surrendering of self, it's realizing that there is no self in the first place. If you die without breaking the delusion of self (conceit), you'll get reborn.   \n\n\nWhat we are supposed to do is to develop the noble 8fold path. Morality to meditate, meditate to get wisdom, get wisdom to break delusion.   \n\n\nI hope you would consider reading other books as this book clearly has failed you. (Arrow's voice.)

He is also an engineer (civil) and is convinced I don't need to take an MSc to get a data scientist job, because he was able to, and that I will learn more in an actual job. According to him, because we already know all the bases (except programming), we would be more than ready for a data job after learning how to program and getting familiar with all the software you use for DS.\n\nSo I really haven't decided yet. For now, I will continue on the course, which is really good for foundations, and am already applying for DS jobs.

You can just take your notes so that to have Active Recall questions there as a separate column (or maybe list them on a separate page).

If I'm trying to learn something via a tutorial, my mind won't concentrate and I block out everything the person is saying.\n\n1. I can learn stuff from video lectures only if I *don't look at the video* &amp; only listen to it (unless there is a visual aid there like a diagram, etc.). I switch to an empty browser tab and look at it OR just look down. That's because everything that's visually happening in the video (the lecturer's face &amp; hands moving, the colors &amp; patterns &amp; objects in the backgrounds) is too distracting\u2026 I zone out of what the lecturer is talking about.\n2. *Additional strategy: doodling during lectures/talks.* It improves focus, comprehension &amp; retention of the information.

It\u2019s both part nurture and nature.\n\nAldous Huxley was remarking on this, when comparing the American and British societies, of which he was part of and maker of both. He realized how the only intelligences recognized in the modern world are really the computative, the communicative, and memorative; which makes sense when you consider that they are the only intelligences that can be measured and tested, to some degree\u2014communicative being the sketchy one.\n \nYou seem to be interested in communicative intelligence. Don\u2019t worry if you sound intelligent in your head, but as you so eloquently put it \u201csound like a complete fool and idiot\u201d when spoken out loud. This was exactly how Alexis De Tocqueville felt, and let\u2019s just say that he was far from the dullest tool in the shed.\n\nThere is however a difference between sounding smart and being smart. Sounding smart, especially in the English language, has a lot to do with class entrenchments, systemic racism, and mental rigidity. David Foster Wallace wrote an acerbic piece on this called Tense Present, which can be found online.\n\nAs for being smart, by normative standards, some people just have more raw memorative power. It\u2019s probably the most referenced paper in psychology: some people can hold at most ten separate chunks at once, while others can only hold three at once. That paper is also why phone number are divided the way that they are now. So thats nature. Our society tends to value the people that can hold ten separate thoughts in higher value even though that has cross-recall drawbacks. [This course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/), offered by UCSD, covers what we currently know about memorative intelligence.\n\nBut having grown up amongst many of these memorative giants, who are now in seats of powers, this one can also say that there is a nurture component to it too. In this one\u2019s case, the people who are naturally computative/memorative are very rarely nice people. They tend to use their intelligence to abuse others, thinking, \u201cHell, I\u2019m smart but means that I also have to do harder work. So I deserve everything I get that you don\u2019t, because it\u2019s hard.\u201d Which sounds fair, but if you just think but one level deeper then the work-reward relationship doesn\u2019t really make sense when you realize at root, one\u2019s cognitive accomplishments are essentially a luck of the neuron mylenation lottery draw. Being gifted doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll keep your gifts forever, while you\u2019re here, it also means that you also have more to give back.\n\nBut back to nurture. The drawback I\u2019ve noticed with people who are computatively/communcatively/memoricativey intelligent, is that they lack a certain courage. Education \u2014 and I\u2019m not talking about a diploma type of education \u2014 a real education, one that vests one\u2019s existence with truth, poise, and an unshakeable center through both adversity and prosperity, takes a certain daring. If you really are to learn what can\u2019t be taught: to think, to understand, and to create, there is nothing that you are not allowed to think, understand, or create about. And because how the ten chunks of memory guy are wired, these types of intelligences cannot see things outside of a very narrow world-view (depth-first as opposed to breadth-first) which is strongly reinforced by the technician-based direction our societies are currently moving in. Quite non-intuitive if you think about it.\n\nShort answer, yes, you can become \u201csmart\u201d. If you want to be communciatively smart, read a lot of books. Both widely and deeply.  Read that David Foster Essay and swallow that hard truth about the English language. Use dependent clauses at the start of your sentences so that one has to read through the end to piece together what the sentence meant. You\u2019ll pick it up through osmosis. So yes, but also no: if you want to be creative, sorry you\u2019ve got to be wired that way. And if you want to be computatively and memoratively smart, also sorry, you also got to be born with it. If you want  change-the-world smarts, one only needs the daring to think about and understand everything under the sun, but then, and most difficult of all, is following through with living out that understanding: you\u2019ll end up \u2018smart\u2019 as side-effect. There are also other intelligences like neuromuscular, tonal, NOT emotional, but those are beyond the purview of language.\n\nWhy did you post this on a Buddhism forum?", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1595208283, "edited": 1595276578.0, "gildings": {}, "id": "fym65ob", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_huadna", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_huadna", "permalink": "/r/Buddhism/comments/huadna/can_someone_who_is_dumb_become_smart_intelligent/fym65ob/", "retrieved_on": 1595302917, "score": 0, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Buddhism", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhnf", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1595208283.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "z-oid", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_138nyi", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "A link to said course. \n\nhttps://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1595185292, "gildings": {}, "id": "fyl19ej", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_htxm4y", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_fykbjxf", "permalink": "/r/learnprogramming/comments/htxm4y/important_concepts_taught_at_collegeuniversity/fyl19ej/", "retrieved_on": 1595279040, "score": 5, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "learnprogramming", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r7yd", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1595185292.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "sevenfootgimp", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_hfgs9", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1595168922, "gildings": {}, "id": "fyk710r", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_htxm4y", "locked": false, "no_follow": false, "parent_id": "t1_fyjoxav", "permalink": "/r/learnprogramming/comments/htxm4y/important_concepts_taught_at_collegeuniversity/fyk710r/", "retrieved_on": 1595260083, "score": 5, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "learnprogramming", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r7yd", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1595168922.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "MariosFFX", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_15mb59", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "I did the following Webinar (it's free, it helped me with my Work and Studies)\n\n [https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/home/welcome](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/home/welcome) \n\nDr Barbara Oakley, one of the professors who does this Webinar has said that doing homework (studies), which are not pleasurable activities and require focus or many other things such as absorbing a lot of information are actually connected to a particular part of the brain that is also connected to **pain.**\n\nFor survival issues we actually want to avoid pain and this we why we procrastinate.

You can also comment on this answer.\n\nWhile the syllabus at your university might not have been upgraded, access to high quality online learning resources at an affordable price (often free!) has become easier. \n\nIt cannot be emphasized enough that the best way to learn is to **learn by doing**. It is important for you to remember that in order to get the best out of the resources.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; How much more C should I learn (specifically what all topics?) \n\nBased on what you shared, it seems that your background in the C programming language might be good enough to get started. You can learn any new concepts as you work on embedded systems.  \n\n\n&gt; finally how to get started with embedded systems (any course  recommendations or resources and what microcontroller to pick up  first?).   \n\n\nEmbedded Systems usually include bare-metal (no OS) microcontroller systems, Real-Time (RTOS based) systems, Embedded Linux based systems, or a combination of these.  \n\nA good starting point is bare metal programming. The complexity of such systems is comparatively lower than those that use an OS. \n\nHere are some MOOCs that might help: \n\n[https://www.edx.org/course/embedded-systems-shape-the-world-microcontroller-i](https://www.edx.org/course/embedded-systems-shape-the-world-microcontroller-i) \n\n[https://www.edx.org/course/embedded-systems-shape-the-world-multi-threaded-in](https://www.edx.org/course/embedded-systems-shape-the-world-multi-threaded-in)\n\nAlthough I haven't followed these courses myself, the syllabus looks very well organized and they have a fair amount of positive [reviews](https://www.classcentral.com/course/edx-embedded-systems-shape-the-world-microcontroller-input-output-1484#reviews).\n\nEven if you decide not to follow these courses, I would strongly recommend understanding all the concepts covered in them. The general principles remain the same across all microcontrollers. It does not matter too much which microcontroller you choose. If you do follow these courses, just get the one used in them. \n\nThe [Modern Embedded Systems Programming](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPW8O6W-1chwyTzI3BHwBLbGQoPFxPAPM) course is an excellent series of lessons by Dr. Miro Samek on YouTube. The way in which the concepts are explained is simply outstanding. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;What other topics to learn (do I need to learn OS, architecture) and \n\nUnderstanding computer architecture is definitely important for learning embedded systems. These two MOOCs look like they cover all of the fundamentals:  \n\n\n[https://www.udacity.com/course/high-performance-computer-architecture--ud007](https://www.udacity.com/course/high-performance-computer-architecture--ud007)\n\n[https://www.coursera.org/learn/comparch](https://www.coursera.org/learn/comparch)\n\nSome of the later lessons might be advanced for an undergraduate student, so take your time with them. The second MOOC might be too advanced for you. I studied computer architecture as part of my university education (bachelor's and master's). I haven't followed either of them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think learning Operating Systems is also an important part of learning embedded systems and it would be beneficial in the long term.\n\nA relatively easy step would be learning how to use an OS like Linux. Embedded systems that require a GUI, vision (camera-based), working with the internet, or any kind of compute-heavy application, primarily use Embedded Linux. When you come across a project whose requirements cannot be met by microcontrollers, you can consider using embedded Linux based boards like Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone Black, or its variants, any other Single Board Computer (SBC) or a System-on-Chip (SoC) manufactured by any of the silicon vendors. Embedded Linux is in essence a trimmed down version of Linux. The command-line interface is the same as the desktop Linux.\n\nOne of the best ways to start learning Linux would be to install a distro like Ubuntu in a virtual machine using VirtualBox. You can look up how to do that. \n\n[The Linux Command Line](http://www.linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php) is a fantastic book that helps you understand the concepts and harness the power of the command-line interface (CLI). If you haven't used the CLI before, it can be daunting in the beginning. The learning curve is also somewhat steep. Working through the book in a slow and steady manner would be a good idea.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe topics mentioned so far are certainly doable for an undergraduate student. If you want to dive deeper, you can look into advanced topics. Do not try to limit yourself in any way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Advanced*\n\nI followed the [Introduction to Operating Systems](https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-operating-systems--ud923) course on Udacity to understand the concepts of a general-purpose OS. Although it is an introductory course, it might be a little advanced for an undergraduate student. If you do follow the course, make sure to do it after you have studied computer architecture. Also, there is a lot of material covered, so it can take more time than other MOOCs.\n\nReal-Time Operating System (RTOS) is usually covered in a master level program. There is [another MOOC](https://www.edx.org/course/real-time-bluetooth-networks-shape-the-world) for that. The course by Dr. Miro Samek also covers it. You can consider working on them after you have worked on bare-metal projects. \n\nYou can get a basic understanding of Real-Time Systems concepts by reading [this documentation](https://doc.micrium.com/display/osiidoc/Real-Time+Systems+Concepts). FreeRTOS has a [book](https://www.freertos.org/Documentation/RTOS_book.html) and a simulator to learn about it.\n\nLinux Kernel and Driver development is another advanced topic. [Another question](https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/hsbyuc/resources_for_embedded_linux/) has got it covered. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Good to have*\n\nLearning C++, MATLAB, and Python would be advantageous. Do not spend too much time on learning languages. Just learn the basics so that you become familiar with them and can use them in a project when necessary. \n\nGit is a great tool for version control. Look up tutorials on how to use it.\n\nYou could acquire basic level mobile application development skills over a winter/summer vacation. Home automation and Internet-of-Things (IoT) projects might need an app.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome points to keep in mind are:\n\n* The resources shared are just some of the ones available at the time of writing. You can expect to find new MOOCs, books, or other online resources now or in the future. Feel free to explore [https://www.edx.org/](https://www.edx.org/), [https://www.coursera.org/](https://www.coursera.org/), [https://www.udacity.com/](https://www.udacity.com/),  [https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/,](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/) and other websites for content.  \n* MOOCs and books are just a good starting point. When you work on projects, you get a deeper understanding and actually acquire skills. So spend more time on *doing* and not just studying.\n* Learning independently can be frustrating at times. It is not unusual to get stuck on an issue for a considerable amount of time only to realize later that the solution was too simple. Don't despair when you stuck. Feel free to use your favourite search engine. Stackoverflow can be helpful. You can also post your technical queries on forums hosted by microcontroller manufacturers, SoC vendors, and discussion forums.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1595094472, "gildings": {}, "id": "fyhbm77", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_hs35lo", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_hs35lo", "permalink": "/r/embedded/comments/hs35lo/roadmap/fyhbm77/", "retrieved_on": 1595201638, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "embedded", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qins", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1595094472.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "hellowings", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_rctve", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "1.

Gig economy jobs are often low-balled and it's pretty hard to be competitive as a complete beginner. I'm not saying you should completely avoid Fiverr and Upwork, you can probably make some money there along the way, but if I were you I'd try to focus on the long term payoff.\n\nRemote jobs are becoming more and more viable (especially since COVID), and you may be able to land yourself a high paying job sooner than you think.\n\nSo, I would do it in this order:\n\n1. Build your skills as a programmer (keep an eye out for Fiverr and Upwork jobs along the way)\n2. Get at least 3 small things in your portfolio (even things like a little To-do list app fine).\n3. Get yourself on `LinkedIn` and keep your profile updated. It blew my mind when I found out how many friends got their jobs through LinkedIn. I was recruited for my current job there and I still get emails from recruiters there a few times a week.\n4. Start researching and applying for internships and jobs (you can keep building your portfolio while you do this).\n\nFor building programming skills:\n\nI've used lots of the resources mentioned here by others on my way to becoming a full stack developer. I had no formal programming education, my only experience close to it was with tweaking some css on a Wordpress site, and I did it through a year or two of self-directed learning.  u/Shox187, u/NameNotGroot, u/-_-look, and u/Snoo9985 already posted some great advice but I'll add my two cents.\n\nOne of the most important things for a self-directed learner is to have some kind of path or map (you need to know what you don't know!)\n\n*  [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) \\- A great place to start and good to work through at your own pace. But I don't think you need to do the entire thing. I'd recommend just these 5 certifications (in order) to start. They're more than enough to get you going:\n\n1. Responsive Web Design\n2. JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures\n3. Front End Libraries\n4. Data Visualization\n5. APIs and Microservices \n\n* [developer roadmaps](https://roadmap.sh/roadmaps) \\- These can be good to consult once you feel like you have gotten through the 5 freeCodeCamp certifications listed above. I'd recommend the `Front End`, `Back End`, or `React` road map. Even if you just use it to help fill in the gaps.\n\nAs others have said, you don't want to be stuck doing tutorials forever. One of the main problems with tutorials is that you rarely need to stop and solve a problem for yourself, and solving a problem yourself is the way you'll develop a deep understanding of the subject. This is one of the reasons `freeCodeCamp` is so great, they have sections where you need to solve a problem without much hand holding.\n\nSo by the time you get to the 4th or 5th certification above, I'd recommend trying to come up with a few small projects to work on. It's even better if you can find someone to work on these with because you can work on good [git](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-y_2zWrIE&amp;list=PLWKjhJtqVAbkFiqHnNaxpOPhh9tSWMXIF) practices at the same time.\n\nCourse resources:\n\n* [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) \\- Great if you know what you want to learn. I'd use this if `freeCodeCamp` doesn't cover something you need to know, or if you want more guidance on a specific technology (like JavaScript, Node, GraphQL, etc).\n* [edX](http://edx.org/),  [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) \\- I tend to use these for deeper, more theoretical learning (Comp Sci, Math, etc). They're great but I feel like they aren't always immediately practical and more likely to be useful to you down the road. \n\nDocs and tips:\n\n* [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) \\- Great docs all things web, especially JavaScript\n* [CSS tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) \\- CSS is surprisingly hard\n\nWhen you're ready to start applying for jobs and interviewing:\n\nYou'll probably feel like you aren't qualified for most jobs but apply for anything intermediate and below. Still be honest about your experience but once you're in contact with a recruiter or hiring manager you may find out that they also have something more entry level available.\n\nLinkedIn is probably your best bet (at least as of the time of writing). Job boards are helpful too but they are usually loaded with applicants (especially remote ones like [remoteOk.io](https://remoteOk.io) and [weworkremotely.com](https://weworkremotely.com)). One thing you can do here is go through older job listings on job boards and find companies that previously posted. I kept a spreadsheet of those companies and would periodically check their websites for job listings. There is often far less competition for a job that is only listed on a company's website.\n\nInterview prep resources:\n\n* [Codility practice lessons](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/1-iterations/) \\- Difficult, but great prep for coding challenges\n* [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://crackingthecodinginterview.com) \\- Helpful book\n\nGood luck, and I'm sure you can do it if you persist!", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1595072266, "gildings": {}, "id": "fygd9f8", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_htao61", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_htao61", "permalink": "/r/learnprogramming/comments/htao61/i_am_from_a_third_world_country_and_dont_come/fygd9f8/", "retrieved_on": 1595072276, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "learnprogramming", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r7yd", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1595072266.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "Xc4lib3r", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3pnduiuo", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Pornhub I guess?\nJust kidding, try this out, copied:\nOld post I saved a while ago.

To make learning into a quantifiable goal, you can set a quota for # of Pomodoro sessions spent on studying+reviewing ([someone's example](https://imgur.com/a/0YHJrXq) for tracking planned vs actual sessions), or/and the number of MOOC courses you've finished // Btw, (1) all courses on Coursera are free at least in Audit Mode, some of them are free even in Full Mode \u2014 that's when you can submit Assignments for peer-review &amp; submit graded quizzes; and those are the courses from the best universities of the world. (2) classcentral.com is a good aggregator of all existing MOOCs, from multiple platforms, with ratings. \n2. For testing your comprehension, Active Recall *(e.g. google for Cornell Notes)* and the Feynman Technique *(a close alternative: explain what you've learned as if to a 10-year-old).*\n3. To actually be able to remember what you've learned, despite the forgetting curve, Spaced Repetition. Also, project-based learning is considered very effective (it's, basically, working on a task/project that allows you to apply what you've learned &amp; encourages additional learning in the process).\n\nAs for how-tos, \n\n* Check out *science-based* rules for effective &amp; efficient studying. These two reference files are adapted from the books that a very popular &amp; free online course on Coursera, [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn), is based on (in the course materials, the lecturers provide the links to the supporting research studies):\n  * 10 rules of good studying and 10 rules of bad studying ([this 2-page PDF](http://www.math.toronto.edu/nhoell/10rules-of-studying.pdf)).\n  * a somewhat different version for kids &amp; teens ([this 2-page PDF](https://barbaraoakley.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/10-Top-Ideas-to-Help-Your-Learning-and-10-Pitfalls-1.pdf)). \n* There is also AGES model for effective learning. I'll just quote the book I've been reading, The Coaching Habit: *\"Josh Davis and colleagues from the NeuroLeadership Institute have created the AGES model to explain the 4 main neurological drivers of longer-term memory. \u201cAGES\u201d stands for Attention, Generation, Emotion and Spacing. What\u2019s useful here for us is the G: Generation. This is \u201cthe act of creating (and sharing) your own connections to new and presented ideas\u2026 When we take time and effort to generate knowledge and find an answer rather than just reading it, our memory retention is increased.\u201d This is why, in a nutshell, advice is overrated. I can tell you something, and it\u2019s got a limited chance of making its way into your brain\u2019s hippocampus, the region that encodes memory. If I can ask you a question and you generate the answer yourself, the odds increase substantially.\"*\n* Ali does great videos about effective studying. E.g. [this video bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONG26-2mIHU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=724) shows how he does *retrospective timetables* (it's for Spaced Repetition sessions) in Notion. You can do it in a paper notebook as well. Earlier in that video he shows how to incorporate Active Recall questions in your notes in Notion (you can do the same in Workflowy or Dynalist, free account, but he doesn't know about them). Or you can do it in a paper notebook, in Cornell Notes format.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1594836013, "edited": 1594836678.0, "gildings": {}, "id": "fy614xy", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_hrkkyb", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_hrkkyb", "permalink": "/r/BettermentBookClub/comments/hrkkyb/im_wanting_to_make_reading_and_learning_a/fy614xy/", "retrieved_on": 1594849955, "score": 2, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BettermentBookClub", "subreddit_id": "t5_34j5y", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1594836013.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "darkgreyghost", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_30j8jvdl", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Yes, I've seen those studies. I'm highly confident IQ is flexible and something you can improve by changing how you approach problems. This is actually the reason behind the 30 points of IQ improvement we saw in the last generation in America. That's not a genetic change. This is called the [Flynn Effect,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vpqilhW9uI) and Dr. Flynn attributes this to a new scientific method of thinking. Solving and stimulating your mind with math and science problems can develop more efficient new ways and approaches to solving problems. It's no surprise this can improve IQ.\n\nOn top of this, I've experienced with various nootropics (smart drugs), including amphetamines, methylphenidate, piracetam etc. They can change your mental performance easily, so I've experienced what it's like to be at peak mental performance and low mental performance. Trust me, even if my forgetful self at my lowest point (due to drug comedown) can solve a calculus problem, so can most people. Although I think sleep and exercise are still the best way to improve focus and working memory. Something which is easier for someone that's disciplined with good impulse control.\n\nFinally, I work at a top tech firm as a software engineer and we all use what's called \"Leetcode problems\" in our hiring interview process. They make IQ tests look like absolute jokes. They are significantly harder by comparison. Some of the ones asked by Google/Facebook, for example, are so hard that even if you are exceptionally smart, you'd still need a ton of practice first. But the thing is, you can get better. Any normal person can get better. The more you practice these problems, the better you get at them. You approach new problems more efficiently, with better strategies. That's how people get into these big companies. Many prepare for 6 months and solve as much as 200-400 problems. Each problem taking 30 minutes to finish. Hard work easily beats talent here, even though these problems can seem like the greatest mind puzzles. There's also a ton of new research to suggest just how flexible our brain is and how one can master a skill through better learning. There's a free course on [this](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn). Literally one of the best courses I've taken in my entire life.\n\nI'd say as long as you are a healthy normal individual without any genetic abnormalities that greatly hinder your brain function, you can generally succeed in life with hard work and the right guidance. Even if let's say person A has 30% lower working memory capacity than person B, as long as person A works 40% harder, they can beat person B. The point is, hard work beats talent for most people. That's my belief as someone who had a very diverse range of experience in my life, and now I'm making six figures in my 20s.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1594823599, "edited": 1594824547.0, "gildings": {}, "id": "fy5bc05", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_hptpxe", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_fy4szg4", "permalink": "/r/mealtimevideos/comments/hptpxe/what_is_intelligence_where_does_it_begin/fy5bc05/", "retrieved_on": 1594834788, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "mealtimevideos", "subreddit_id": "t5_32abf", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1594823599.0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "longdonglos", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_13dnga", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Not trying to discourage you, but for the most part, if you have you ask how to go about creating a genome database it's probably impossible for you to accomplish it at this time.\n\nThe concept your suggesting falls into a field known as bioinformatics.

Sleep and exercise are super important.\n2. Tackle the most uninteresting or difficult task of the day first, preferably early in the morning (in your case MatLab)\n3. Try Pomodoro, an effective technique to combat procrastination.\n4. Focus on the process, and not the product. Process: learning MatLab, learning how to play with vectors and matrices and how to plot in MatLab. Product: the achievement of learning MatLab.\n\nEdit 2:\n\nA. What is happening to you is that you don't really want to study Matlab, it's not appealing and when you start studying it, the pain centres of your brain start triggering. You are literally in pain and your brain is asking you to quit. Keep at it for a few minutes and the pain will subdue. Which is why in the Pomodoro you are supposed to do high focus study for 25 minutes straight. There are different reasons for taking the 5-minute break, but doing that will help you a lot. \n\nB. Try mixing up Matlab with something else. Let's say you are also studying Fluid Mechanics Nowadays, so what I would recommend is that you do the following: 25 minutes of Matlab-5 minute break (FB, twitter, Reddit, music, yoga, whatever)- 25 minutes of fluids-5 minute break-Matlab-break-Fluid. And thus you have studied for 2 hours in a session. A HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE SESSION. Do whatever you want, come back, follow up with another 2 hour long 2-25 minutes pomodoro session.

Specifically, I had a end goal of building 3 image/webcam/video recognition programs on my computer and writing a paper that compares each of it. Before that, I had to also really understand the variety of modules within Python because I was actually not that familiar with it ( i only learned Java and that was when I was in middle school.) Therefore, I implemented 2-3 mini projects every week in the span of few months that makes my Python knowledge more solid. These mini projects increase in how challenging it is every week. \n\nI actually also had a journal in OneNote, and pasted all of my study calendars and project screenshots within it so I can keep track. This is a great way to keep yourself accountable as you are able to visualize your accomplishments/ what else you need to work on. Additionally, I found supporting texts on the internet to strengthen my interests. This was veeeerrry helpful for me, but I would understand if you think it is useless.

So if you've not been learning about that already, start now. Understand what things make you frustrated or lead you to misunderstand things. Understand how your brain currently works so you can best equip it to succeed. In a more practical sense:\n\n * Understand what [learning techniques](https://collegeinfogeek.com/learning-styles-vs-techniques/) you already feel fluent in and which ones you currently feel ill-at-ease with. Know that there is room to grow here.\n\n * Read [this article](https://celandine13.livejournal.com/33599.html?fbclid=IwAR3wAUKUaG5Oc3idd6l8LQsNJImtmx_XC7n2UxYZsC_EYaKI41zmoSpLWqk) with the understanding that it is up to you to plan someone's education: your own.\n\n * Take the free course [learning how to learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) over a weekend.\n\nBe prepared to question all of the above as you learn more about yourself.\n\n### 2) Know Python and its toolset\n\nKnowing your language really well is a strong advantage because you will be able to think more clearly about the new concepts you are learning in class rather than getting bogged down in syntax.\n\n\"Know yourself\" is relevant here. If you're most effective at learning from books, [Think Python](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) is a solid one. If you learn better via a course [6.0001 is not bad I hear](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/). Python has lots of resources.\n\nDon't forget to learn how to use ipdb.\n\nTry to build some tiny practical things in python. Work through tutorials.\n\nAlso, if you have ADHD, then you do yourself a **massive** favor and learn to use py.test and automated testing techniques intimately.\n\n### 3) Know a text editor, unix, and a shell scripting language moderately well\n\nThis is just to make your life easier and faster. If you feel really comfortable in emacs or vim or VSCode or whatever, then you'll be able to think more clearly. If you [already feel comfortable with linux](https://archive.is/xDb8o) and can save yourself time by writing [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) scripts, you can able to spend that time sleeping and your brain needs sleep.\n\n### 4) Learn to communicate about technical ideas\n\nThis is mostly something that you'll learn *at* MIT by working with other students on problem sets.

Mas as pausas s\u00e3o importantes.\n\n4) Antes de estudar o assunto, use o site de quest\u00f5es que assinou para filtrar as quest\u00f5es daquele concurso. D\u00ea uma olhada no que cai e tente resolver algumas. Depois, folheie o livro/apostila e veja o t\u00edtulo das se\u00e7\u00f5es que voc\u00ea vai estudar, legenda das figuras, legenda das tabelas etc. Depois disso, a\u00ed sim voc\u00ea estuda. Quando terminar de estudar o assunto, volte pro site de quest\u00f5es e fa\u00e7a mais quest\u00f5es de concurso: refa\u00e7a as que tinha feito no in\u00edcio e fa\u00e7a mais.\n\n5) De tempos em tempos \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio revisar as quest\u00f5es. Quando for dormir, j\u00e1 deitado na cama, PENSE no que estudou e tente te contar (em pensamento mesmo) o que voc\u00ea aprendeu. Isso vai fazer com que voc\u00ea revise a mat\u00e9ria e vai ajudar o modo difuso do seu c\u00e9rebro durante o sono. Al\u00e9m disso, lembre que eu disse no item 2 para separar umas 3 ou 4 mat\u00e9rias para estudar por dia, certo? Mas nesses dias, revise as outras que n\u00e3o est\u00e1 estudando (eu sei, isso tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 estudo). A revis\u00e3o pode ser feita atrav\u00e9s de exerc\u00edcios: use o site que voc\u00ea assinou.\n\nFazendo isso direitinho eu garanto que vai aumentar seu percentual de acerto rapidamente.\n\nSugiro fortemente pra todo mundo o curso \"learn how to learn\" no coursera.

Unfortunately, your problem may be more difficult than it may seem at a first glance. Here are my few thoughts:\n\n* **The problem you're describing is called 'classification'** \\- where in your case you try to classify a word (or a sound) depending on the mouth shape (correct me if I'm wrong tho). I would probably google something like 'mouth shape classification machine learning' or 'lip reading classification machine learning' to start.\n* **If in a rush** \\- try to find some machine learning practitioners that would like to collaborate you. Without any previous knowledge in ML it may take you a very long time (even years) before you can see some reasonable results - and even that assuming you have some programming/maths experience.\n* **If not in a rush** \\- start by doing some basic ML courses and build your knowledge up. After a few months you should begin to see some potential answers to the question you posted. For instance the famous [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course is a reasonable place to get an introduction.\n* **Consider using a platform such as** [**Cloud AutoML**](https://cloud.google.com/automl) \\- yet even there you'll need a substantial amount of knowledge to produce any satisfactory results.\n* **Verify your dataset** \\- Not entirely sure if the images you have will allow you to reach the goal you're aiming for. You may want to verify if your dataset is even viable, if this is your main motivation to get into ML. Again collaborating with someone with ML expertise may help you find the answer.\n* **Look for existing solutions** \\- are there existing ML models that do what you need them to do? Would you consider licencing these models? Or could you learn from how they did it? Maybe get in touch with the authors?\n* **Is this a hobby project or you're considering turning this into a business?** If you're doing it just for the kicks then you probably wouldn't need to worry about a few things - and I would encourage you to give it a shot, sounds like a cool project! Otherwise if you're thinking to make a business out of it, then this is yet again a much more difficult task than it may seem - ensuring the dataset is high quality, broad and bias-free, that your accuracy is reasonably high, that your prediction time is reasonably low, etc.\n\nFeel free to ask follow up questions if needed.

You can actually make them in Active Recall format. I.e. Cornell Notes format if on paper. Or, if you do it in Notion (it's free for students as far as I know) or Workflowy (free account is enough for average level of note-taking), the top-level list item is the active recall (testing) question, and the sublist is your notes from the lectures that answer that question. [Here is the demo for Notion](https://youtu.be/ONG26-2mIHU?t=534).\n\nE.g. in [this video bit](https://youtu.be/ONG26-2mIHU?t=724) Ali shows how he does Active Recall note-taking/formatting in Notion (the same thing can be done in Workflowy). \n\n**#3** Personally, I can watch lecture videos only if I *don't look at the video, just listen to it* (I switch to an empty browser tab and look at it OR just look down).
